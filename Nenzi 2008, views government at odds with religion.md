Nenzi 2008, Commodified experience of travel
*Nenzi 2008, Excursions in Identity Travel and the Intersection of Place, Gender, and Status in Edo Japan*
##### Review by Wigen
shogunal* authorities constantly had to contend not only with commoners on the move but with competing power bases as well, including a sprawling religious establishment whose representatives ranged from marginal mendicants to entrenched priestly hierarchies.
more circumspe highlighting the legal conflicts and grudging compromises that gra ally widened the scope for women to worship at distant temple shrines, she reveals that devotional travel was not just a way for moners to push back against an oppressive regime, but the sit separate struggle between political and religious
Commercialization of travel was hardly new in eighteenthcentury Japan; the selling of amulets and sacred services had been practiced for centuries, and evidence of souvenir shopping dates back as far as the 700s (pp. 148-49). But by late Edo, the market had mushroomed to become the dominant medium through which places were experienced.

#### sees views government at odds with religion
Historically, the political domination of space had always had to come to terms with a formidable contender, the religious establishment. Religious discourse had traditionally mapped space—the same space—with a different brush, privileging exclusive areas of karmic superiority, spaces of cleanliness, and peaks endowed with sacred meanings. Not exclusively an Edo period phenomenon (as the example of Mandala of a Pilgrimage to Mount Fuji, discussed later, demonstrates), the religious alternative to official mapmaking continued to increase and diversify itself in the early modern period.

##### notes how offiicial government  maps dont show people or list all  towns between sekisho gates 
Illustrated Map and Survey of the Tòkaidò accurately details the position and layout of such post stations and the intersections of the main highway with smaller secondary roads. It records the names of each district and outlines the borders between provinces. It also includes details on each station’s revenue, the width and depth of the major rivers that crossed the route, and the distances between post towns. Even such seemingly objective details in fact concealed the social and political agendas of the government. As Herman Ooms indicates, from the early Edo period the cartographies of officialdom made it a point not to include, in the computation of distances between two points, the stretches of the road that passed through outcast villages, **effectively depriving such communities of any voice and of any relevance**.13 (18)

Finally, Illustrated Map and Survey of the Tòkaidò illustrates an array of natural and man-made features of the landscape: rivers and forests, hills and lakes, houses and temples, shrines and bright-red gates. The map is so rich in detail that at a first glance the observer would be tempted to declare that it includes everything down to each single tree along the Tòkaidò highway.16
A closer look, however, reveals one significant and telling omission.
Unlike on other road maps, there are no people journeying across this space. Despite being produced during the 1830s, at the peak of what many scholars recognize as the era of a veritable “travel boom,”17 this map of officialdom r ­epresents a silent, immobile landscape undisturbed by any human activity or presence.18
Like the government that had demanded its creation, this map is ubiquitous yet aloof. Some of the stylized fences reproduced in Illustrated Map and Survey of the Tòkaidò mark the access to the compounds of checkpoints (sekisho). Not only their presence throughout the country, but also the fact that they referred prospective travelers to an array of local branches of government to obtain transit permits characterized sekisho as pervasive symbols of the Tokugawa’s long-reaching arm.19 Checkpoints, and the array of ordinances and laws that came with them, established and maintained a hierarchy of space that, from early on, set the spaces “this side of the barriers” (seki yori uchi) apart from those “which are far beyond” (engoku no bun).20 As a result,
these strongholds of Tokugawa authority became the instruments by means of which the government simultaneously achieved, enforced, and reiterated its comprehensive organization and management of the territory.  (19)
