Hardships of travel ^886943

Dangers more from being ignorant tourist
	The traveler did have to be on the lookout for porters who might try to extort money or merchants who charged "ignorant tourists" exorbitant prices.15 Even one carrying two swords {samurai) had to be careful not to be cheated in a place where he was not known. Far from his native Shonai, Kiyokawa Hachiro ordered a drink of sugared water on a summer's afternoon, forgetting to ask the price beforehand. When it came time to pay the bill he was charged twenty mon per person. He attributed the high price to the fact that they "looked like they were from another province, just travelers passing through, so the proprietor could do as he pleased with them." In resignation, Kiyokawa shrugged his shoulders, saying that it was "unavoidable since it was after the fact" (i.e., that it was his fault for not asking the price before ordering).16 (Vaporis 1994, 220)

	the mechanisms of checking stations, or sekisho, and travel permits, for "control the movement of the defeated forces". 27
	This policy is popularly known as iri-demp6 ni de-onna, or "in-bound guns and out-bound women." Why block women?

economic
	"monetary requirements of taking a recreational trip imposed a natural curb on that activity. Personal financial limitations,' however, could be overcome in part by participation in a religious confraternity (k6), in which economic resources were pooled to send a number of members on pilgrimage on a periodic basis" 30

social
	"As pilgrimage was a principal Objective for travel by commoners, it is not surprising that most regulations were directed at it. Some of the ways in which domains sought to regulate pilgrimage were by: 1) setting certain economic qualifigations for the issuance of travel permits; 2) determining when and where travel was allowed; 3) determining who was allowed to travel; and 4) the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel.. Not every domain used all of these methods, but a number of them were common to many." 29
	..
	"The best way to restrict the numbers leaving the domain on pilgrimage would' have been simply to ban it altogether. Nevertheless, only a small number of domains went so far as to take this unpopular step-and even then the ban was usually for a limited durationâ€¦When a domain government did prohibit pilgrimage, its motivation appears to have been primarily economic-to prevent the outfiow of domestic resources." 29

	"While these cases are only from one diary, they are suggestive of the types of pressure brOught to bear upon women, even those on pilgrimage, during which social norms of expected behavior ordinarily were suspended." 30
