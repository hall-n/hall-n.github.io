Dangers more from being ignorant tourist
	The traveler did have to be on the lookout for porters who might try to extort money or merchants who charged "ignorant tourists" exorbitant prices.15 Even one carrying two swords {samurai) had to be careful not to be cheated in a place where he was not known. Far from his native Shonai, Kiyokawa Hachiro ordered a drink of sugared water on a summer's afternoon, forgetting to ask the price beforehand. When it came time to pay the bill he was charged twenty mon per person. He attributed the high price to the fact that they "looked like they were from another province, just travelers passing through, so the proprietor could do as he pleased with them." In resignation, Kiyokawa shrugged his shoulders, saying that it was "unavoidable since it was after the fact" (i.e., that it was his fault for not asking the price before ordering).16 (Vaporis 1994, 220)
