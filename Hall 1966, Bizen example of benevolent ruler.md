#### Bizen's Mitumasa's quality of social responsibility
In Bizen Mitsumasa quickly proved himself one of the great daimyo of his age, gaining a reputation as one of the “three outstanding administrators” of the Tokugawa period. The events of Mitsumasa’s rule are therefore doubly important, since it was under him that the institutions of the Tokugawa Great Peace were firmly established (402)
in Bizen and since Mitsumasa provides us with one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age. (403)

The outstanding quality which Mitsumasa brought to Bizen was a certain style of benevolent authoritarianism based on Confucian principles of governance. Mitsumasa_ built upon the foundations of faitacy organization and civil administration which had been laid by his predecessors, filling out the body of codified injunctions and bureaucratic precedents. But he went further and added to his rule the indispensable ingredient of moral rationale. Mitsumasa was not alone in this. The Tokugawa bakufu had led the way in drawing upon the concepts of Confucianism and seeking ideological justification for its regime in the claims of benevolent government. Mitsumasa’s fame rests on the fact that he pioneered in adapting these ideas to the field of daimyo rule and that he so persistently sought to regulate his own conduct by them. (403)

Failure of the year’s crop brought famine conditions in its wake, and the suffering of the peasantry during the winter of 1654 was extreme. Mitsumasa took these events as a direct reflection on his rule, and reacted vigorously both by providing relief for the sufferers and by admonishing his housemen for lax behavior. He believed that in too many instances his enfeoffed retainers had sacrificed the welfare of the peasantry in order to squeeze taxes from their fiefs. ..
After the flood of 1654, Mitsumasa became much more the firm authoritarian ruler of his domain, preaching frequently to his assembled housemen about the need for discipline, loyalty, and selfless service to the people of the domain. (406)

#### Wanted education for commoners
Meanwhile he proceeded with a vigorous educational policy. In 1660 a new domain college (karigakkan) based on Confucian principles was begun and in 1668 a system of elementary writing schools (tenaraijo) for commoners was ordered into effect. The latter proved too costly and had to be abandoned. Education for the upper levels only of the common people was eventually taken care of after 1670 with the establishment of Shizutani School (Shizutani gakko) to which samurai also went.  (408)

#### Bizen was common type of ruling
The administration of Bizen was typical of the kind which was provided by the larger daimyo of the Tokugawa period. (410)
