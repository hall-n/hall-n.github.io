*Kouamé 1997, Shikoku’s local authorities and henro during the Golden Age of the Pilgrimage*

As long as the pilgrims followed regulations, the local authorities supported pilgrims ^kouameArgument

##### Kouame argues that Shikoku can't be used as standard for Japan, but if Shikoku authorities are following bakufu rules, then we can assume a certain level of uniformity  
- Kouame reasons that the help of sick pilgrims might be just following bakufu rules for common travellers.


 
Purpose:
- sociological aspects of shikoku henro 
- local administration

While bakufu's policies of control were there, the rigid system became lax
	The reception that the Shikoku authorities gave to henro reveals that the political authorities of the latter Tokugawa period were tolerant regarding the mobility of the ordinary populace. 
	..
	the rigid system established during the seventeenth century did change, some of its basic principles became lax, and the development of travel among ordinary citizens was symptomatic of these social changes (see, for example, UCHIDA 1996). (413)

Can see this development in Shikoku pilgrimage 1800-1850 
	the case of Shikoku could provide an example of the degree of tolerance seen in an administration renowned for its severity and the degree of µexibility of a social system known for its rigidity. At the same time such an investigation would enable us to acquire a very concrete understanding of the conditions of the pilgrims (henro ’−) in the Tokugawa period, to know who the pilgrims were, and also to measure their impact on local societies in Shikoku. (414)


Local authorities tried to control pilgrims.
	authorities did seek to regulate the pilgrims closely, and to proscribe unruly elements, they also provided a system of support for those in need who followed the regulations. (424)

But their relationship was good
	Provided the pilgrims observed the regulations, they could pass throughout the island and devote themselves to their religious practices. (424)
	In case of illness or death, such pilgrims could also depend on local of³cials, who organized their medical care, their repatriation, or their burial (424)
	the proportion of people, and especially of pilgrims, who were helped to return home was quite significant....	It it clear that such assistance was standard practice.
	When Shikoku authorities helped a sick pilgrim return home, or buried a dead one, it is conceivable that they were just following the rules for common travelers that had been established by the Tokugawa bakufu since the end of the seventeenth century (423)

Argues that local authorities should not be analyzed in terms of oppressive control. Benevolence relevant.
	Indeed there are various historical materials that suggest that the general attitude of local authorities in Shikoku towards the henro should not be 
	analyzed only in terms of repressive control. The fact is that the Shikoku authorities during the Tokugawa period did help pilgrims who were in trouble (421)


- Did they succeed in efficiently controlling the henro who came from outside, who were constantly on the move, and therefore who were not well integrated into the social order?


Perspecitve of the pilgrims was accepting of imposed restraints
	From the perspective of the pilgrims, it appears that they accepted the bureaucratic restraints that were imposed on them, for in the context of the freedom that the authorities were actually granting, these regulations could be seen as comparatively insigni³cant constraints. (424)
