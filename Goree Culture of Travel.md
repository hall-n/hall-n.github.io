*Goree 2020, The Culture of Travel in Edo*


#### Trade meant freedom of movement for lower classes
These merchants and artisans enjoyed much freedom of movement because of their societal role in distributing and retailing rice and other goods needed in both cities and the countryside. Exemplifying such movement, itinerant peddlers traveled trade routes to sell goods as varied as medicine, cooking utensils, farm tools, and books.  By contrast, the authorities restricted travel among samurai to official shogunal and domain business. Those wishing to take leave of their posts to travel for medical treatment or sightseeing might be able to do so but only after obtaining special permission through a tedious application process (5)

## Reasons for travel 
#### Surge in travel caused by economic and population growth 
26 This remarkable surge in leisure travel peaked from the 1780s to the 1840s due in large part to the accumulated economic effects of dramatic population growth and the commercialization of agricultural production from the 17th century onward. By the time production of agricultural commodities sold on the open market had become widespread and highly efficient in the late 18th century, many farmers in the Kansai region around Osaka and Kyoto had attained sufficient wherewithal to take to the road for pilgrimage and other non-utilitarian reasons. (5)
#### Short trips were cheaper and common
Shorter outings were an option when lengthy pilgrimages proved unfeasible. Reachable within days rather than weeks and requiring much less expense and planning, popular pilgrimage destinations within striking distance of Edo included Shinshō-ji temple on Mount Narita to the east, Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō to the north, the thirty-four temples associated with Kannon in Chichibu to the northwest, and Mount Ōyama and the shrine to Benzaiten on the small island Enoshima to the southwest. Women gravitated to these relatively nearby places because they did not require passage through barrier stations, in particular the Hakone checkpoint, which stood as a carefully policed gateway to the major pilgrimages further west.

36 Much shorter trips taken within and around cities also grew popular. In Edo, day-trippers visited the one hundred Konpira sub-shrines linked to the main shrine on Shikoku or miniature replicas of Mount Fuji, which female members of the popular Mount Fuji cult climbed as a substitute for summiting the real mountain, which they were prohibited to do. 7

#### Temples and oshi
Itinerant proselytizers representing specific temples and shrines (called onshi in the case of Ise Shrine and oshi for other sites) made the rounds of villages and cities in the winter off-season to support confraternities and recruit new pilgrims—**another crucial factor in the popularity of pilgrimage in the period.** These professional proselytizers also acted as travel agents by arranging lodging for confraternities and working as tour guides at pilgrimage destinations. By 1777, Ise onshi effectively had the entire country covered with patrons in roughly five million households (out of a total population of approximately twenty-six million people).
33 In the case of Mount Tateyama, oshi raised the number of pilgrims to about six thousand annually by traveling the country and explicating mandalas representing the remote mountain. 34 Playing a similar role, some temples attracted visitors with kaichō: public displays of paintings, sculptures, and holy relics that occasionally became traveling exhibitions. (7)
Temples and shrines sponsored this growth for the sake of economic advantage by making recreational goods and services available within or just beyond their gates. Notwithstanding the efforts of some Buddhist sects like Jodō Shinshū and Nichiren to preserve the sacredness of pilgrimages, most sacred destinations drew income from food stalls, teahouses, and theatrical performances, and nearby pleasure quarters offered dancing, singing, and prostitution to those in search of more revelry (8)
#### Health reasons for travel 
Onsen authorities considered soaking in geothermal waters a legitimate medical treatment for various illnesses and ailments 7

#### Travel offered freedom
Exposure to local culture through visits to these culturally significant sites, as well as more ludic attractions, contributed to the pilgrim’s sense of temporary freedom from the constraints of everyday life, namely one’s occupation, social status, and gender—and helps explain why the sacred and profane intermingled so freely in the context of Edo-period travel. 8

## Effects of travel
#### Meibutsu flourished
Travelers in general spent a good deal of money on local specialty products (meibutsu), which handy guidebooks helped to popularize.

### Academic discussions
Useful historical overviews published from the 1980s by Konno and Kanzaki explore the cultural consequences of travel as an institution shaped by the state. Their tendency to approach the

topic through the lens of political administration is more pronounced in an earlier generation of scholars, including Kodama, Maruyama, and Igarashi, who dwell on how the shogunate regulated travel through transportation infrastructure, such as road systems, barrier checkpoints, and post-stations. In the 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of scholars began to approach institutional history as a way to link travel to political developments. In studies about alternate attendance and recreational travel, Constantine Vaporis challenges the view that the authorities fully controlled travel, stimulating new directions in research that account for travel from the perspective of travelers. Representing a different strain of institutional history, Ronald Toby and Gregory Smits analyze the movements of foreigners in and around Japan to demonstrate the complexity of foreign relations in the region and critique the still-persistent notion that Japan was completely closed off from the rest of the world during the period. 18-19

Much of the scholarship linked to travel and culture in the period concerns pilgrimage and pilgrimage sites. There remains little debate about whether the sacred and profane blended in the act of pilgrimage, as seen in the work of Nelson Graburn and Susanne Formanek, but there are diverging interpretations about how and why this occurred. Under the influence of modernization theory, Nishiyama Matsunosuke theorizes a process of evolution by which the religious act became increasingly secular, culminating in full-blown recreational travel with devotional elements by the end of the period. Challenging this teleological view, Higuchi Kiyoyuki, Shinno Toshikazu, and Nam-lin Hur argue for the complementarity of religious devotion and recreational pleasure during the entire period. 91 Sarah Thal, Max Moerman, and Barbara Ambros enter into the debate with in-depth studies of specific temples and shrines, analyzing them as layered landscapes with cultural, devotional, socioeconomic, and political dimensions. Laura Nenzi’s contribution is to account for identity, gender, and the commodification of culture in the lived experience of travelers. 19
