Understanding 
	"shogunal autocracy" and "rationalized bureaucratic mechanism" characteristic of the early-eighteenth-century bakufu, but also our perception of the underlying dynamics of the Tokugawa system of rule (xi)

Not change in philosophy, but flexible reaction to changing economy
	Hagiwara's career thus testifies to a continuity underlying the dramatic twists and turns that characterized the surface of bakufu monetary policy during these decades; it suggests that overall those twists and turns, including the Shiitoku move from debasement to restoration, reflect not so much the shift from one economic philosophy to another as a flexible pragmatism in trying to deal with the ongoing contradictions of the midTokugawa economy (105)

Hakuseki's policies
	(1) policies concerning the fiscal foundations of bakufu rule; (2) approaches to the function and mechanism of governance; (3) measures pertaining to the symbolic definition of shogunal authority. (96)
Fiscal proved most enduring, shogunal didn't last long or were not implemented, and governance and administrative were mixed. 
	Analysis of the first three issues will show that, contrary to what is often assumed, in these areas there was substantial congruence between Hakuseki's position and that of other influential figures within the bakufu. (96)


Coinage
	THE BACKGROUND OF DEBASEMENT AND RECOINAGE. While sharp shifts in monetary policy characterized the four decades between the 1690s and 1730s, one factor was constant: a shortage of precious metals available for coinage. By common calculation the bakufu, in its early years, possessed enormous metallic wealth. Ieyasu left substantial amounts of gold and silver to his descendants, and the output of the bakufu gold and silver mines compensated for the portion of his legacy used up by Hidetada and Iemitsu. But, by the end of Iemitsu's reign in 1651, the output of the mines had dropped sharply. To meet the bakufu's financial needs, bakufu administrators turned to minting the reserves left by Ieyasu. By 1680, when Ietsuna's reign ended, the ordinary reserves had been exhausted, and minting began of the special store of ingots Ieyasu had set aside for use only for a military emergency.
	debasement of the currency begun in 1695...Moreover, although its immediate purpose was to enlarge bakufu income, debasement had the side effect of expanding the supply of money at a time when existing currency resources could not keep up with the demands created by commercialization of the economy-one of the by-products of peace and the Tokugawa system of rule.3 (98)

Not at expense of people
	Hakuseki's attention to the psychological dimensions of recoinage also probably had some impact on the procedures adopted for carrying out the restoration. Stressing the need for the bakufu to keep the confidence of the people if the restoration was to succeed, Hakuseki argued that the bakufu should not seek its own profit at the expense of the people, but should instead bear the cost of the recoinage. (101)

The economic issues more critical than political tensions
	The magnitude of the economic issues of the early eighteenth century, however, transcended the structure of factional politics. The fact that currency restoration-and other economic reforms discussed below-was accomplished within the context of the polarized politics of Ietsugu's reign shows that the necessity to cope with immanent economic problems could foster a working resolution of the tension between the bakufu old guard and the shogunal circle.
