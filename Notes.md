In the media that helped to popularize that tourism (Fabricand-Person 2011), the authorities show no negative reaction, allowing maps to be used freely (REF) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RESEARCH</mark>

The idea that authorities were for or against pilgrimage starts with the issue of translation. In Japan there is not just one word for "pilgrimage" but over ? that denote the purpose or way in which the travel was undertaken.

It is therefore critical to look at which type of pilgrimage the bakufu tolerated and for what reason. This point is underscored in Ambros research (2008).

As Thal argues, "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (2005, 102). 



argues that the religious institutions of Ōyama had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and travel related services (Nenzi).

As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).

Nenzi observes new attractions in pilgrimage that came consumption of non-religious elements
