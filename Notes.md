巡礼　→　寺社参詣　さんけい

## Original

これに対して、当局がその旅行から社会的・経済的利益を得られたため、幕府は反対していなかったと私は主張する。

江戸時代の旅行に関する研究では、寺社参詣による観光産業が盛んであったことが明らかにされているが、幕府や大名は農民の巡礼や観光、特にそれが余暇が動機であった場合には、明確に反対していたと多くの歴史家は主張している。
このような主張に対して、当局が観光や参詣から社会的・経済的利益を得られたため、幕府は反対していなかったと私は主張する。参詣を奨励した宗教団体の経済的動機と、それが参詣の商業化にどのようにつながったかを理解し、それらの参詣者が地域に与えた影響を観察することによって、その利益が明確になる。
そして、幕府や大名が社会的な懸念のある参詣にも積極的に対応し、支援したことや、観光地を直接作り、振興させたことを示す研究からは、当局が参詣による観光産業の繁栄に明確な関心を持っていたことが明らかになった。
さらに、江戸時代の政策に関する研究からも、戦国時代までの権威主義的な立場から、庶民の経済的な幸福を追求する立場へ移行したことが分かる。
従って、幕府や大名が庶民の移動を制限することを望み、寺社参詣が経済成長につながる一方で、参詣が悪影響を及ぼさないようにするために旅行に関する規制を行ったという考えには反対である。

While studies of travel during the Tokugawa period reveal a flourishing tourism industry from pilgrims, many historians present the situation as the bakufu and daimyo authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and sightseeing, particularly when it had leisurely motivations. 

Furthermore, research demonstrating the bakufu and daimyo's positive response and support for even problematic pilgrimage, and evidence of their direct creation and promotion of non-religious tourist destinations, reveals that the authorities had a clear interest in the flourishing of the tourism industry which came from pilgrimage. In addition, research on governance during the Edo period reveals a shift from an authoritarian position towards a benevolent ruler that sought the economic well-being of the common people. I argue, therefore, against the idea that the bakufu and daimyo authorities wished to restrict the movement of the commoners, and that the regulations they made pertaining to travel were to ensure that pilgrimage did not have a negative impact while allowing it to grow the economy.

by Vaporis (1994, 2012) on travel infrastructure and the permit system of the Edo period. In his research, which made significant contributions to the study of Tokugawa travel in English, he overturns previous assumptions of the bakufu's nature of being authoritarian, intrusive, and closely regulating all aspects of society.

**Dichotomy**
Our idea that pilgrims used pilgrimage as a pretense (or *tatemae*) under which they hid their real intent of pleasure travel (*honne*) is not an excuse to get around the bakufu's rules. Rather, it represents the fact that the pilgrimage consisted of both enjoyable sightseeing and religious worship, the separation of which is a modern phenomenon, as argued by Shinno. "The accounts seem to me to illustrate the inextricable conjoining of faith and pleasure that constituted the essence of the phenomenon of pilgrimage" (Shinno 2002, 469). 
"The modern dualistic ethic, with its positing of an opposition between the sacred and the profane, did not exist in that context. This was true also of travel" (ibid). 

"There remains little debate about whether the sacred and profane blended in the act of pilgrimage" (Goree 2020, 19).



The strictness of the Shikoku authorities can be arguably their response to a particular pilgrimage that was sometimes problematic. 
### Why this research is meaningful	
This research reveals not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, 
These points are both vital to understanding what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan.


## non-authoritarian
"Tokugawa hegemony Japan was governed under the broad unifying capacity of the shogun, but actual administration was partially decentralized under the regional authorities of the various daimyo", therefore describing as feudalistic is misleading as the structure was more bureaucrat (Hall 1966, 345).

as the authorities flexible pragmatism as they react to the changing economy (Nakai 1988). 

"The early modern system was not unremittingly oppressive but gave many institutions opportunities to operate on their own terms by harnessing local and regional resources" (Ambros 2008, 239).


The bakufu were focused on keeping a balanced market and growing yields, and to that end they intentionally left a surplus of rice with the peasants;

This focus of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity is also reflected in how the authorities restructured and managed the rice tax, as argued in Hall (2022). 

This trend can be traced back to the **beginning** of Edo period when **they** restructured the rice tax and prioritized agricultural development, which meant improving the quality of life for the commoners. 
research of Tokugawa bakufu and daimyo governance reveals a trend of moving away from authoritarian methods of control and prioritizing the welfare of the people. As the entire tax system was based on the efforts of the farmer, this would result in their own prosperity. 


there is clear evidence that the bakufu and daimyo were lenient in allowing travel of the lower classes (Ambros 2008; Thal 2005),

the question of why is not touched upon

In all the historical materials of the dysfunctional aspects of the Shikoku pilgrimage, Kouamé advices caution. "To infer from them that pilgrims of this sort were numerous and dangerous to the social order could well be erroneous" (ibid, 420), because while a bureaucracy's does not note the cases where everything is in order.

## Vaporis


Contrary to the idea of dealing with the commoners harshly, "[o]fficials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners" (ibid, 216). 
As both of these groups' income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities. 

Tokugawa authorities' support of pilgrimahe and tourism
the precarious position the bakufu put the daimyo in also gave the han rulers reason to focus more and prioritize the reaction of their peoplw. 
makes her case by 

The observations from this research, perhaps our image of the bakufu's intent and method of dealing with the peasants needs reassessing, as from their legislation they do not appear to be purely adverse to the pilgrimage of commoners. 


**leisure**
Traganou argues that Tokugawa discouraged non-official travel



Government did not recognize the concept of tourism, and therefore discouraged all recreational or touristic travel", pointing the Kaga domain that stated that sightseeing was of no worth (Vaporis 1995, 32). 



**Guidebooks**
The boom in travel led to the publication of a number of guidebooks that introduced famous and historic sites, shrines and temples throughout the country in text and pictures, which encouraged people to travel and helped to increase the number of tourists (Ando 2021)



**Abstract** 

While studies of travel during the Tokugawa period reveal a flourishing tourism industry from pilgrims, many historians present the situation as the bakufu and han authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage, implementing a system of barriers and strict rules to impede their movement. Other research reveals a clear laxity in allowing travel, as the they make permits easier to obtain and provide support for pilgrims in need during their travels. I argue that the reason behind these apparent conflicting actions lies in the variety of pilgrimage and the effect that they had on the communities. By understanding the economic motivations behind the travel promotion that led to the increase of mass pilgrimage and the commercialization of travel, and observing the effect which those pilgrims had on the region, the social and economic benefits of tourism from pilgrimage become clear. In addition, research on the governance of the bakufu and the daimyo reveals a shift from an authoritarian position towards a benevolent ruler that sought the economic well-being of the common people. I argue, therefore, against the idea that the bakufu and daimyo authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants, and that the regulations they made pertaining to travel were to ensure that pilgrimage did not have a negative impact while allowing it to grow the region’s economy.

The governance of the bakufu, and the daimyo who followed the bakufu's example, was not authoritarian but was focused on keeping their region prosperous and responding to the needs. 


Increase in tourism. Many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and travel, implementing a system of barriers to impede their movement, barriers which the peasants found ways to circumvent. Other research into travel and the permit system, however, reveals that both the daimyo and bakufu were clearly tolerant towards allowing peasants to travel, showing hesitance to enforce the laws that controlled peasants mobility.

the bakufu was reluctant to enforce travel limitations on peasants.

the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the

commercialization of travel economic motivations behind travel promotion which gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a

assumption that the authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants and does not take into account the economic benefits that the tourism from pilgrimage brought. The bakufu and daimyo’s position was not authoritarian, but was focused on keeping their region prosperous. Using recent research that reveals cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that as long as travel did not negatively effect the peasant’s production, the bakufu and daimyo had more reason to allow its practice because pilgrimage brought commerce due to its tourist nature. This explanation of the authorities’ economic objective explains why they took steps to keep travel within reason, seeking to eliminate _nukemairi_ pilgrimages which had a negative effect on the regions while making permits for ?? more easily obtainable.

the economic motivations that lie behind both the travel agent like _oshi_ who encouraged peasants to travel and the

combined with the bakufu’s position of being a “benevolent’” ruler gave them less incentive to stop the peasants from traveling than it did to simply manage the system to keep up with the sudden surge of pilgrimage travel.

I argue that the bakufu and daimyo position towards peasant travel was not to confine farmers to their lands, but to ensure that their movement did not have a negative economic effect. This explains why they responded to the surge in travel by making proper travel permits easier to obtain.


**Vaporis argument**

While it is true that the bakufu implemented a system of travel regulations and barriers to monitor the movement of people, at the same time they also show a reluctance to enforce its travel laws for commoners.

Vaporis concludes that while the bakufu made certain restrictions of travel, the peasants found ways to circumvent these barriers and thus were not immobile. Although his argument challenges the idea that the authorities fully controlled people’s movements, he does not directly ask the question of why they showed such lenience to the travel of commoners. Among the few comments that Vaporis makes regarding the intent of the authorities, there is only his claim that the daimyo and bakufu idealized the population being tied to the land, though that may not be the same as being against their travel if it did not negatively affect their responsibility of that land. While Vaporis’ position may be difficult to pin down,


This paper seeks to answer the questions that Vaporis' research reveals but which are left largely unasked; why the bakufu and daimyo authorities were so permissive of pilgrimage if it was argued to be so disruptive to society and threatened the ruler's authority and damaging to the economy? If were are to assume that the authorities were positioned against travel, why do we observe such lenience towards it? 

Countless persons from all social ranks defied governmental authority by traveling without official permission despite the volumes of legislation intended to regulate or restrict movement. (Vaporis 1994, 12)

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. 

Rather than come out against pilgrimage with strong measures and enforced punishments, government authorities were content to issue and re-issue prohibitiens which were hortatory in nature and thereby functioned more as sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 215)


Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain. 


**Maps and media**
In the media that helped to popularize that tourism (Fabricand-Person 2011), the authorities show no negative reaction, allowing maps to be used freely (REF) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RESEARCH</mark>

**tango**
The idea that authorities were for or against pilgrimage starts with the issue of translation. In Japan there is not just one word for "pilgrimage" but over ? that denote the purpose or way in which the travel was undertaken. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REFERENCE</mark>
It is therefore critical to look at which type of pilgrimage the bakufu tolerated and for what reason. This point is underscored in Ambros research (2008).

As Thal argues, "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (2005, 102). 

## Key Phrases

- bakufu implemented a system of travel regulations and barriers to control the mobility of commoners
- reluctance of the bakufu to enforce its travel laws
- commoners, however, found ways to circumvent these barriers, frequently ignoring the laws designed to control their mobility.



**position of benevolent ruler** and being primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity. 
Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up ( #Paramore_2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" ( #Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule ( #Cambridge, #Hall_1966 ). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" ( #Vaporis 1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.


The bakufu envisioned the peasant's being tied to the land ( #Vaporis), as the rice crops were the  
Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF).

argues that the religious institutions of Ōyama had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and travel related services (Nenzi).

As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).

Nenzi observes new attractions in pilgrimage that came consumption of non-religious elements

**Auhorities response**
the rice tax, the fact that the authorities left the peasants with a surplus reflects their priority of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity. 

), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. 


This focus on ensuring the prosperity of the common people reflects the changing governance structure of the bakufu and reflected in common styles of daimyo structure, what has been described by some historians as "benevolence" (REF).

My argument goes beyond that to argue that there was a trend in the governance of both the bakufu and the daimyo toward this benevolence rule, or liberalistic rule (REF).


More specific example of that government's political stance can be seen in Paramore's research ( #Paramore_2012 2012) on changes in governance that occurred during the later half of Tokugawa period.


"Commoners led the response "with a mercantilist strategy of protection and development of the commercial economy. They resisted the economy of service by creating a new economic rhetoric that decentered the lord, imagined the domain as an economic country, and gave merchants a public worth and identity unknown in Confucian economic thought. This thought and activity changed domainal government, and played an important role in the decline of shogunal authority, producing proto-nationalist practices and rhetoric that influenced Meiji era national development" 

"Petitioning, through regular channels to middle-level officials and through the more special petition box that sent opinions directly to the lord, was a device to integrate opinions of those outside of the government hierarchy into the decision-making process of the rulers"

Roberts argues that the concept behind merchants and other parties who were engaged in commerce was the rhetoric of *kokueki*, which means "prosperity of the country".
