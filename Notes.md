Traganou argues that Tokugawa discouraged non-official travel

"sightseeing in the towns was not encouraged" (Traganou 2004, 15) makes her case by pointing out how in Confusianism leisure was not good.

they sought to "discourage recreation, inessential travel, and other 'unproductive' uses of time" (Totman 2005, 265)

Government did not recognize the concept of tourism, and therefore discouraged all recreational or touristic travel", pointing the Kaga domain that stated that sightseeing was of no worth (Vaporis 1995, 32). 



**Guidebooks**
The boom in travel led to the publication of a number of guidebooks that introduced famous and historic sites, shrines and temples throughout the country in text and pictures, which encouraged people to travel and helped to increase the number of tourists (Ando 2021)



**Abstract** 

While studies of travel during the Tokugawa period reveal a flourishing tourism industry from pilgrims, many historians present the situation as the bakufu and han authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage, implementing a system of barriers and strict rules to impede their movement. Other research reveals a clear laxity in allowing travel, as the they make permits easier to obtain and provide support for pilgrims in need during their travels. I argue that the reason behind these apparent conflicting actions lies in the variety of pilgrimage and the effect that they had on the communities. By understanding the economic motivations behind the travel promotion that led to the increase of mass pilgrimage and the commercialization of travel, and observing the effect which those pilgrims had on the region, the social and economic benefits of tourism from pilgrimage become clear. In addition, research on the governance of the bakufu and the daimyo reveals a shift from an authoritarian position towards a benevolent ruler that sought the economic well-being of the common people. I argue, therefore, against the idea that the bakufu and daimyo authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants, and that the regulations they made pertaining to travel were to ensure that pilgrimage did not have a negative impact while allowing it to grow the region’s economy.

The governance of the bakufu, and the daimyo who followed the bakufu's example, was not authoritarian but was focused on keeping their region prosperous and responding to the needs. 


Increase in tourism. Many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and travel, implementing a system of barriers to impede their movement, barriers which the peasants found ways to circumvent. Other research into travel and the permit system, however, reveals that both the daimyo and bakufu were clearly tolerant towards allowing peasants to travel, showing hesitance to enforce the laws that controlled peasants mobility.

the bakufu was reluctant to enforce travel limitations on peasants.

the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the

commercialization of travel economic motivations behind travel promotion which gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a

assumption that the authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants and does not take into account the economic benefits that the tourism from pilgrimage brought. The bakufu and daimyo’s position was not authoritarian, but was focused on keeping their region prosperous. Using recent research that reveals cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that as long as travel did not negatively effect the peasant’s production, the bakufu and daimyo had more reason to allow its practice because pilgrimage brought commerce due to its tourist nature. This explanation of the authorities’ economic objective explains why they took steps to keep travel within reason, seeking to eliminate _nukemairi_ pilgrimages which had a negative effect on the regions while making permits for ?? more easily obtainable.

the economic motivations that lie behind both the travel agent like _oshi_ who encouraged peasants to travel and the

combined with the bakufu’s position of being a “benevolent’” ruler gave them less incentive to stop the peasants from traveling than it did to simply manage the system to keep up with the sudden surge of pilgrimage travel.

I argue that the bakufu and daimyo position towards peasant travel was not to confine farmers to their lands, but to ensure that their movement did not have a negative economic effect. This explains why they responded to the surge in travel by making proper travel permits easier to obtain.


**Vaporis argument**
This paper seeks to answer the questions that Vaporis' research reveals but which are left largely unasked; why the bakufu and daimyo authorities were so permissive of pilgrimage if it was argued to be so disruptive to society and threatened the ruler's authority and damaging to the economy? If were are to assume that the authorities were positioned against travel, why do we observe such lenience towards it? 

Countless persons from all social ranks defied governmental authority by traveling without official permission despite the volumes of legislation intended to regulate or restrict movement. (Vaporis 1994, 12)

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. 

Rather than come out against pilgrimage with strong measures and enforced punishments, government authorities were content to issue and re-issue prohibitiens which were hortatory in nature and thereby functioned more as sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 215)


Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain. 


**Maps and media**
In the media that helped to popularize that tourism (Fabricand-Person 2011), the authorities show no negative reaction, allowing maps to be used freely (REF) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RESEARCH</mark>

**tango**
The idea that authorities were for or against pilgrimage starts with the issue of translation. In Japan there is not just one word for "pilgrimage" but over ? that denote the purpose or way in which the travel was undertaken. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REFERENCE</mark>
It is therefore critical to look at which type of pilgrimage the bakufu tolerated and for what reason. This point is underscored in Ambros research (2008).

As Thal argues, "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (2005, 102). 

## Key Phrases

- bakufu implemented a system of travel regulations and barriers to control the mobility of commoners
- reluctance of the bakufu to enforce its travel laws
- commoners, however, found ways to circumvent these barriers, frequently ignoring the laws designed to control their mobility.



**position of benevolent ruler** and being primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity. 
Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up ( #Paramore_2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" ( #Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule ( #Cambridge, #Hall_1966 ). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" ( #Vaporis 1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.


The bakufu envisioned the peasant's being tied to the land ( #Vaporis), as the rice crops were the  
Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF).

### Motivation
Travel in the Edo period was mostly done by foot and on average one could cover **40 kilometers in a day**. Depending on the destination, the trip could take weeks or even months to complete, costing both time, effort and money.
#### Popular image of pilgrimage
the image of pilgrimage gained from popular media.
A positive travel image with connotations of religious image of a sacred wanderer and seen as a rite of passage (REF)

argues that the religious institutions of Ōyama had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and travel related services (Nenzi).

As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).

Nenzi observes new attractions in pilgrimage that came consumption of non-religious elements

**Auhorities response**
the rice tax, the fact that the authorities left the peasants with a surplus reflects their priority of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity. 

), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. 


This focus on ensuring the prosperity of the common people reflects the changing governance structure of the bakufu and reflected in common styles of daimyo structure, what has been described by some historians as "benevolence" (REF).

My argument goes beyond that to argue that there was a trend in the governance of both the bakufu and the daimyo toward this benevolence rule, or liberalistic rule (REF).


More specific example of that government's political stance can be seen in Paramore's research ( #Paramore_2012 2012) on changes in governance that occurred during the later half of Tokugawa period.


"Commoners led the response "with a mercantilist strategy of protection and development of the commercial economy. They resisted the economy of service by creating a new economic rhetoric that decentered the lord, imagined the domain as an economic country, and gave merchants a public worth and identity unknown in Confucian economic thought. This thought and activity changed domainal government, and played an important role in the decline of shogunal authority, producing proto-nationalist practices and rhetoric that influenced Meiji era national development" 

"Petitioning, through regular channels to middle-level officials and through the more special petition box that sent opinions directly to the lord, was a device to integrate opinions of those outside of the government hierarchy into the decision-making process of the rulers"

Roberts argues that the concept behind merchants and other parties who were engaged in commerce was the rhetoric of *kokueki*, which means "prosperity of the country".
