The idea that authorities were for or against pilgrimage starts with the issue of translation. In Japan there is not just one word for "pilgrimage" but over ? that denote the purpose or way in which the travel was undertaken.

It is therefore critical to look at which type of pilgrimage the bakufu tolerated and for what reason. This point is underscored in Ambros research (2008).

As Thal argues, "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (2005, 102). 

## Key Phrases

- bakufu implemented a system of travel regulations and barriers to control the mobility of commoners

**position of benevolent ruler** and being primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity. 
Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up ( #Paramore_2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" ( #Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule ( #Cambridge, #Hall_1966 ). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" ( #Vaporis 1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.


The bakufu envisioned the peasant's being tied to the land ( #Vaporis), as the rice crops were the  
Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF).

argues that the religious institutions of Ōyama had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and travel related services (Nenzi).

As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).

), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. 


This focus on ensuring the prosperity of the common people reflects the changing governance structure of the bakufu and reflected in common styles of daimyo structure, what has been described by some historians as "benevolence" (REF).

My argument goes beyond that to argue that there was a trend in the governance of both the bakufu and the daimyo toward this benevolence rule, or liberalistic rule (REF).


More specific example of that government's political stance can be seen in Paramore's research ( #Paramore_2012 2012) on changes in governance that occurred during the later half of Tokugawa period.


"Commoners led the response "with a mercantilist strategy of protection and development of the commercial economy. They resisted the economy of service by creating a new economic rhetoric that decentered the lord, imagined the domain as an economic country, and gave merchants a public worth and identity unknown in Confucian economic thought. This thought and activity changed domainal government, and played an important role in the decline of shogunal authority, producing proto-nationalist practices and rhetoric that influenced Meiji era national development" 

"Petitioning, through regular channels to middle-level officials and through the more special petition box that sent opinions directly to the lord, was a device to integrate opinions of those outside of the government hierarchy into the decision-making process of the rulers"

Roberts argues that the concept behind merchants and other parties who were engaged in commerce was the rhetoric of *kokueki*, which means "prosperity of the country".
