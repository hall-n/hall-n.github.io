*Oshid et al 2011, A Study on the Developmental Process of the Route Planning and the Staying Base on Kamakura Tourism in Early Modern* 

##### Kamakura first centered on shrines & temples, but with time scenery sightseeing's value became known.
このことより， 鎌倉観光は基本的には有名社寺の参詣を中心とした観光形態であったといえるが，時代の経過に伴って通過するだけであった海岸 沿いにも観光価値を見出すようになった様子が伺えた。
This suggests that sightseeing in Kamakura was basically a form of sightseeing centred on the visit to famous shrines and temples, but as time went by, people also began to see the value of sightseeing along the coast, which they used to only pass through.

また， 宿屋の利用の主目的は宿泊であったものの，19世紀以降は有名な 宿屋を中心に食事や休憩，海岸景観の眺望といった宿泊以外の一 時的な滞在などが展開される記述がみられた。この背景には,宿屋 の展望地化や名所化があると推測される。
Although the main purpose of using inns was to stay overnight, from the 19th century onwards, descriptions of temporary stays other than overnight stays, such as meals, rest and views of the coastal scenery, were found mainly at famous inns. It is assumed that the background to this is the transformation of inns into places with a view and famous places of interest.



##### Evidence: Description of teahouses only after 1805, thus sightseeing emerged as a new tourism.
また，茶屋に関する記載は『10.江の島』以降においてのみであっ たことから，観光経路や宿屋の利用目的の多様化に伴って新たな 観光産業として台頭した茶屋が，休憩を通じて道中の景観を楽し む旅行形態を確立させる要因となったと推測される。
The fact that descriptions of teahouses were only found after "10. Enoshima" (from1805) suggests that teahouses emerged as a new tourism industry as sightseeing routes and the purposes for which inns were used became more diverse, and that teahouses became a factor in establishing a travel style in which people enjoyed the scenery along the way through breaks.


茶屋は，宿泊拠点周辺に加え鎌倉海岸沿いで展開されており， 特に道中における景観の転換点となる稲村ケ崎では，絵図の販売 や講釈，眺望を売りとした多様な観光産業が繰り広げられていた。 また，茶屋は 19 世紀以降のみでみられたことより，観光経路 や宿屋の利用の変容に伴って台頭した新たな産業といえる。
The fact that teahouses were only seen from the 19th century onwards indicates that they were a new industry that emerged in line with the transformation of tourism routes and the use of inns. The above shows that tourism in Kamakura, which mainly consisted of pilgrimages to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine and other shrines, has been changing since the 19th century, and that it has become a new industry.

以上より，「鶴岡八幡宮」などへの参詣が主であった鎌倉観光は，19世以降，観光経路や宿屋の利用目的の多様化，茶屋の台頭など により，道中の休憩や宿泊を楽しみながら巡るものへと変化した ことを捉えた。
The above shows that, from the 19th century onwards, sightseeing in Kamakura, which used to consist mainly of paying homage to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine and other shrines, changed into a form of touring while enjoying rest and lodging along the way due to the diversification of sightseeing routes and the purpose of using inns and the rise of tea houses.

その過程の中で，宿屋や茶屋より海岸景観への眺 望を得る仕掛けづくりがなされるようになり，海岸景観が有益な 観光資源として評価されるようになったと考えられる。
In this process, a mechanism to obtain a view of the coastal landscape from inns and teahouses was created, and the coastal landscape came to be evaluated as a useful tourist resource.
