## Abstract
(100-300 words)

While studies of travel during the Tokugawa period reveal a flourishing tourism industry from pilgrims, many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage, implementing a system of barriers and strict rules to impede their movement. Other research reveals a clear laxity in allowing travel, as they make permits easier to obtain and provide support for pilgrims in need during their travels. I argue that the reason behind these apparent conflicting actions of the bakufu lies in the variety of pilgrimage and the effect that they had on the communities. By understanding the economic motivations behind the travel promotion that led to the increase of mass pilgrimage and the commercialization of travel, and observing the effect which those pilgrims had on the region, the social and economic benefits of tourism from pilgrimage become clear. In addition, research on the governance of the bakufu and the daimyo reveal a shift from authoritarian position towards a benevolent ruler that sought the economic well-being of the common people. I argue, therefore, against the idea that the authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants, and that the regulations they made pertaining to travel were to ensure that pilgrimage did not have a negative impact while allowing it to grow the region's economy.  


# Thesis
## Introduction
As Japan entered an era of peace in the beginning of the Tokugawa period, the bakufu took steps to ensure that daimyo would not have the means of uprising by implementing the alternate attendance system which required daimyo to make regular trips to Edo. In order to facilitate this compulsory travel, the bakufu developed extensive infrastructure, building a centralized road network throughout Japan. To ensure that traffic flowed smoothly, the roads were regularly cleaned, wheels that would damage the road surface were banned, and trees and shrubs were planted along the side of the road to provide shade and wind cover. Along the main routes, the bakufu also established post stations that offered lodging, food, and travel services. While these services had to prioritize servicing Tokugawa officials and daimyo, they were allowed to cater to the lower classes. In order to monitor movement throughout the regions, barrier stations, or *sekisho*, were positioned along the road, the passage through which required a permit. While permits of a leisurely nature for pleasure were not issued, a journey for the purpose of pilgrimage or visiting an onsen for health reasons were viewed by the authorities as valid reasons for travel (Goree 2020). 
At the same time that the conditions for travel were greatly improved, the lower classes of peasants and merchants began to find themselves with increasing financial freedom, which made travel more viable (Ishimori 2009). As advances in media captured the appeal of travel, describing famous sights and attractions with many traveler guidebooks being published, pilgrimage became increasingly popular ( #Fabricand-Person_2011). Over time, sightseeing and enjoying local specialties became common elements of the journey, sometimes even turning into the primary focus of the pilgrimage itself (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REF</mark>). Thus the commoner was able to take advantage of the travel infrastructure laid out by the Tokugawa bakufu, enjoying new sights and locations, and out of pilgrimage soon arose a booming tourism industry.

Despite the evident popularity of pilgrimage and sightseeing among commoners, however, many historians have argued that the bakufu and daimyo authorities were negatively positioned against peasant travel, claiming that since it had negative economical impact and the anti-structural elements, that pilgrimage was seen by the bakufu as subversive and therefore posed a threat to their authority (Blacker 1984, Traganou 2004). While the intent of the authorities may be debatable, however, there is clear evidence that the bakufu and daimyo were lenient in allowing travel of the lower classes (Ambros 2008, Thal 2005). In the research of Vaporis on the permit system and travel infrastructure (1994, 1995, 2012), which made significant contributions to the study of Tokugawa travel, he overturns previous assumptions of the government's nature of being authoritarian, intrusive, and closely regulating all aspects of society. Vaporis observes that the checkpoint officials dealt with travelling peasants with an increasing measure of laxity, in contrast to the strictness they showed samurai and upper classes. In fact, he argues, the changes that the bakufu make to the permit system made pilgrimage applications more flexible and easily obtained by peasants, a change that appears to be done in order to encourage travelers to apply for permits instead of leaving without permission. Vaporis concludes, therefore, that while the bakufu made certain restrictions of travel, the peasants found ways to circumvent these barriers and thus were not immobile. 

While Vaporis' argument challenges the fact that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, he positions as is if that is despite the intent or against the desire of the authorities. This paper presents an alternative perspective. Because the market economy was of great importance to the bakufu, as my previous research (Hall 2022) revealed in their efforts to manage the rice market and increase agricultural yield production demonstrated, the economic benefits to be gained from pilgrimage is highly relevant to understanding the intent of the bakufu and daimyo's legislation toward pilgrimage. In addition, the bakufu's lenience toward peasant pilgrims is because the governance of the Tokugawa regime was not authoritarian, but socially responsive ( #Paramore_2012 ) and ? This approach stemmed from the structural changes and acceptance of Confucianism's ethics of benevolent rule that the Tokugawa regime implemented in order to justify their position as shogunate. Therefore, because they were focused on keeping a prosperous economy while seeking the well-being of the people, they would be approving of the rise of the tourism industry from pilgrimage. 

In order to make the connection between the bakufu's lenience and their economic priorities, understanding the situation surrounding pilgrimage is necessary. Beginning with a review of the arguments made by historians regarding the Tokugawa and daimyo authorities' perspective of pilgrimage, first an examination of how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry. This research reveals that the religious institutions looked to pilgrims for financial support, and their promotion of pilgrimage to religious sites led to the surrounding regions competing for the business of pilgrims, resulting in tourism becoming an important industry. Next, analyzing the authorities' response to this industry reveals their underlying objective of keeping pilgrimage from harming the region and surrounding communities, while at the same time ensuring that business could sufficiently profit from it. In addition, observing how the bakufu and local daimyo dealt with travelers of the Shikoku circuit pilgrimage, pilgrims which have been argued to be potentially subversive and antisocial (Blacker 1984, Traganou 2004), reveals that the authorities constrained pilgrimage in order to keep it from adversely affecting the region while offering medical and other support to pilgrims in need. This research outlines the fact that the bakufu and local daimyo authorities were largely positioned against pilgrimage when it was disruptive and took steps not ensure it proceeded smoothly. Finally, from these observations I argue that the reason for such a position lies in the style of ethical governance that slowly began to dominate the Tokugawa period (Paramore 2012). Looking at the "benevolent authoritarianism" (Hall 1966), which became the common style of daimyo rule of these era, and how economic thought from the lower classes began to influence the daimyo (Robert 1998), I argue that the response of the authorities to pilgrimage was not a position against it, but keeping it within reasonable boundaries while allowing it to grow the community. The economic growth of the region was also in their own best interest, both financially and politically; therefore, the lenience toward pilgrimage of the lower classes by the bakufu, and by extension the daimyo, was because they were primarily concerned with the economy and recognized that pilgrimage could further the region's prosperity.

## Argument by Historians
In much of the literature on travel during the Edo period there is an overall perception that the bakufu and daimyo held a position against pilgrimage, wishing to restrict unnecessary movement of the peasants ( #Kanzaki_1995, #Vaporis_2012, #Watkins_2008). While many of the historians that present this perspective do not elucidate on why the authorities would be adverse to this travel, a few have stated that the bakufu and daimyo perceived pilgrimage to be a threat due to its negative social aspects. Traganou (2004) claims that pilgrimage meant abandoning one's occupation and was used as an escape from the restrictions Edo period society.  
%%She points out that this abandonment was reflected in the attire that the pilgrims wore; a white or sleeveless garment and sedge hat %%

Similarly, Blacker (1984) #Blacker_1984  argues that undertaking such travel meant that farmers were neglecting their proper duty, thus the daimyo viewed pilgrimage as "frivolous, useless, extravagant and immoral" (ibid, 604). Though Blacker does admit that some daimyo did not object to pilgrimages which were undertaken during the idle part of the year, she nevertheless claims that the authorities saw this traveler as playing no useful part in human society and a threat to order and stability. In examining how Blacker views the pilgrim reveals an image of a wandering mendicant who wishes to escape from the rules of society, an image that places considerable weight on only a single pilgrim architype, despite there being many reasons and situations surrounding pilgrimage. This antisocial element that both Traganou and Blacker claim to be the root of the authorities' concern is therefore not necessarily an element of all pilgrimages (Ambros 2008). 

**Economic**
Other arguments that explain the authorities position against pilgrimage point to the negative economical factors that such travel brought. Traganou (2004) argues that pilgrimage could interfere with the farmer's agricultural production, to which both the bakufu and daimyo's finances were directly tied. In addition, some pilgrimages upset the local economies, "causing inflation of the prices of rice, straw, lodgings and other necessities" (ibid, 72). In contrast to this, however, is the argument that popular pilgrimage destinations often develop the infrastructures needed to deal with the influx of pilgrims as commercialism becomes a part of pilgrimage (Ambros 2008). 
Another negative economical impact of pilgrimage that is mentioned is the loss of domain financial resources. Vaporis explains how travelling into other regions meant that money would be leaving the domain %% caused concern for the ruler%%, pointing to the example of the Kaga domain restricting pilgrimage to a popular Kyoto shrine, claiming it was to "stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver" ( #Vaporis_1994, 202). 

**Reality**
%%Despite the above reasons which stress the unwanted nature of pilgrimage, the reality was that the legislature towards it %%
The above arguments show that in pilgrimage there exists negative economic elements and at least some pilgrims that gave the authorities cause for concern. When looking at the reality of the legislation towards pilgrimage, however, a hard position of the authorities against pilgrimage becomes difficult to ascertain. This is because that legislation "appears to have been merely a reaction to the social reality that existed and thus, in a sense, was little more than sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 12). In Vaporis's study of the road barriers the travel permit system of the Tokugawa period, he challenges the idea that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, and argues that the peasants found ways to circumvent the barriers. He finds the reality at the road barriers to reveal the authorities' tolerance of travel and the flexibility of the system they implemented, describing the many cases of laxity where checkpoint officials allowed passage for peasants without permits or let slide permit related offenses. 
After his review of government policies regarding travel, Vaporis concludes that they were "on the whole, positive rather than repressive" and quite flexible. "This growing flexibility in a system that originally had been more rigid allowed for - and in fact promoted - the increasing mobility that characterized Tokugawa Japan from the eighteenth century on" (ibid, 5). Vaporis therefore argues against accepting a "legalistic interpretation of Tokugawa Japan" (ibid, 6), as doing so overestimates the state's authority and incorrectly represents peasants as immobile, with their movements severely restricted and strictly inspected at barriers. His conclusion is that the *sekisho* barriers did not significantly impede peasant travelers, despite the intention of the authorities (ibid, 7). He observes that "regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control" (ibid, 198). Contrary to the idea of dealing with the commoners harshly, "[o]fficials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners" (ibid, 216). 
These observations reveal that historians presuppositions about the bakufu's method of dealing with the peasants needs reassessing, as from their legislation they do not appear to be adverse to the pilgrimage of commoners. However, the question of why the authorities were so lax in allowing pilgrimage is one that Vaporis does not ask, as Nosco has noted in his review of Vaporis' work. #Nosco_1996. The arguments of Vaporis that touches on the *intent* of the bakufu therefores comes much in line with Blacker and Traganou, %%describing in length the restrictions and troubles the pilgrims meet with when they pass the barrier and%% arguing how the authorities envisioned the peasants being tied to the land. As both the bakufu and daimyo's income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities. Overall the works of Vaporis eludes an image of the bakufu as if they are positioned against pilgrimage but unable to stop it, thus they show leniency to a fight they cannot win. He concludes that the "regulations, while not without some effect, were not able to stem the irrepressible desire of the masses in Tokugawa Japan to travel" ( ibid, 198). 

In carefully examining these examples of actions against pilgrimage presented by Vaporis and other historians, they appear to be to limit that travel's negative economic effects. Were the authorities really trying to stem the desire to travel? A possibility is that allowing peasants to acquire permits more easily reveals is a result of the underlying motivation to stem pilgrimage that could harm a region's economy, while promoting pilgrimage that could positively increase that economy. Indeed, Vaporis even observes some domains regulating pilgrimage by having specific economic qualifications required in order to obtain a travel permits, such as "determining when and where travel was allowed, determining who was allowed to travel, and establishing the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel" (ibid, 198). While he positions this as if it reflects the authorities' position against pilgrimage, I would argue that it shows their acceptance of it as they try to keep it within reasonable bounds. In contrast to the arguments above, I argue that the pilgrimage overall had a positive economic impact the industry surrounding the tourism that came from it became important for many regions of Edo period Japan. In order to see that impact in perspective, a review of the factors that led to pilgrimage travel being commercialized and giving  rise to tourism.

%%This paper seeks to answer the questions that Vaporis' research reveals but which are left largely unasked; why the bakufu and daimyo authorities were so permissive of pilgrimage if it was argued to be so disruptive to society and threatened the ruler's authority and damaging to the economy? If were are to assume that the authorities were positioned against travel, why do we observe such lenience towards it? %% 

%%Countless persons from all social ranks defied governmental authority by traveling without official permission despite the volumes of legislation intended to regulate or restrict movement. (Vaporis 1994, 12)%%

%%"

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. 

Rather than come out against pilgrimage with strong measures and enforced punishments, government authorities were content to issue and re-issue prohibitiens which were hortatory in nature and thereby functioned more as sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 215)


Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain.

## Commercialization of Pilgrimage
In recent years, historians have begun to approach the topic of Edo period travel from many different angles, asking new questions about why pilgrimage became so widely practiced, and how travelers interacted with their destinations, slowly revealing that the travels of pilgrims turned into what we recognize today as contents tourism ( #SeatonEtal_2017) . While some elements of this tourism dates back to the before the Nara period, such as the buying of amulets and travel souvenirs, the commercialization of travel grew to new heights during the Edo period to "become the dominant medium through which places were experienced" (Wigen 2010, 298), leading to a common type of pilgrim that has been described as a "consumer tourist" (Nenzi 2004, 286).
### Promotion of Pilgrimage for Financial Gain (Kanzaki, Umesao, Thal)
Examining in more detail the factors that led to the rise of pilgrimage  and its commercialization reveals the economic motivations of parties who worked to popularize pilgrimage, as they sought to gain financially from it. The instigators of that promotion are what have been described as the first travel agents: the temple and shrine affiliated *oshi* ( #Kanzaki_1995 Kanzaki 1995, 49). In the beginning of the Edo period, the religious institutions began to lose financial support from the bakufu, and in an attempt to compensate for this they worked to attract pilgrims to their shrines and temples. In Ambros' research (2008) of Ōyama, a mountain shrine and temple complex located in the Kanagawa Prefecture, she argues that these *oshi* were the key players in growing the popularity of pilgrimage, and it was due directly to the their efforts that the Ōyama religious site transformed into such a major tourist destination.

These *oshi* appealed to pilgrim travelers by arranging for the their accommodation, providing tour guides, and offering useful travel information  ( #Umesao_1995). While originally much like a missionary on behalf of their shrine or temple, over time they became more merchants than priests, each with their own territory ( #Kanzaki_1995). A major element of the *oshi*'s promotion was the level of hospitality and entertainment that they offered pilgrims, such as preparing luxurious silk bedding and providing extravagant banquets that made use of the local gastronomic specialties. They also presented souvenirs and gifts to the pilgrims. However, underneath this "hospitality lay a cunning business spirit. What they intended was advertisement with maximum effect ( #Kanzaki_1995, 48)". After the pilgrims returned to their village, they would talk about the luxury they enjoyed and this would lead to additional pilgrim recruitment for the *oshi*. 

The financial gain that came from pilgrimage was not something that was felt by shrines and temples alone, however. While talismans and religious offerings were important elements of one's pilgrimage, the commerce potential of pilgrims was much larger. An example of this is *meibutsu*, which became an important element for travelers, with locations advertising their local specialty cuisine as a marketing strategy in order to promote their popularity. Nenzi observes that the creation of many popular travel destinations was owed specifically to the presence of a *meibutsu* (2004, 302). "Gastronomies and knickknacks provided a convenient way to forge a link with a travel destination for those who did not wish to experiment with the ethereal and often slippery pillow words of poetic travel" (Nenzi 2008, 155). No longer did formal education preclude the traveler "from symbolically 'owning' a site—all it took now was a string of coins and, sometimes, an appetite" (ibid). The consumption of these non-religious elements grew to be widely popular, and to the demand of the pilgrims, the tourism industry responded with merchandise "Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement" (ibid 156). 
Souvenirs to bring back to the pilgrim's hometown had become an important aspect of the trip itself, as it gave validation of one's travels and offered the experience with those of the village who could not visit themselves. Similar to tourism in modern day Japan, a wide variety of industries took advantage of they link their to the region or religious site and marketed themselves as *meibutsu*. Among souvenirs from the pilgrimage at Marugame, for example, the advertisements listed not only locally made fans that had an association with the local diety but also oil and miso. They also offered patent medicines such as "Mt. Zozu Kongobo's renowned Konjinmaru" and "Konshotan" (Thal 2005, 102).  
It was not physical products alone that took advantage of pilgrims, however, as teahouses and brothels quickly became popular stops on one's pilgrimage, with some prostitutes becoming famous *meibutsu* themselves (REF).  The popularity of these non-religious elements was in turn taken advantage of by the religious groups, "making recreational goods and services available within or just beyond their gates" (Goree 2020, 8).  
The effects of pilgrimage, therefore, were felt far beyond the industry of travel, and created a situation of competition between regional businesses and religious sites. From that competition cases of conflict did arise, however even their negative effect on community members serves to outline just how important pilgrimage became to the region. 

### Consumerist Pilgrims (Nenzi, Thal)
#Nenzi_2004)
Just how big of an industry pilgrimage became for some regions can be seen in Nenzi's research (2004, 2008) into the interactions of pilgrims and their destinations during the Edo period. Using as a case study the region of Sagami, located in modern day Kanagawa prefecture, Nenzi traces the many cases of conflict between regional parties who competed for profits from these pilgrims. To resolve this conflict, those parties turned to the regional governments and Edo authorities to stop practices that resulted in the decline of pilgrim visitors.

In one example from 1650, the head of a temple of the goddess Benzaiten in Enoshima complained that local fisherman were selling the deity's amulets and leading travelers to their own establishments, instead of telling them how to reach the temple's lodgings. This resulted in a loss of income for the temple, thus they petitioned the shrine and temple magistrate in Edo to put a stop to what they felt were illegitimate inns. The response from the magistrate was a compromise, allowing the private non-temple affiliated inns to be run when there was an overflow of travelers which the temple could not accommodate. As for the amulet distribution, it could continue as long as "those who benefited from it also provide services to the temple" (Nenzi 2004, 306). 
Despite this ruling, the fishermen and other local entrepreneurs continued to target pilgrims, and over the decades tensions between them and the temple persisted. Nenzi observes the temple's efforts of commercialism, as they offered various accommodations packages and special amenities and provided elaborate meals and entertainment to guests. Nenzi argues that the attractions that drew pilgrims to this area developed into a commodification of local history and regional specialties, revealing a new common type of pilgrim that Nenzi calls the "consumer tourist" (ibid 286). "As commercialism burgeoned and the historical icons of the past became the trinkets and menu items of the present, the modalities of the interaction between visitors and sites also expanded dramatically, taking on new nuances that did not replace but complemented the old ones" (Nenzi 2008, 154). By the nineteenth century the number of pilgrims grew to the point that the temple infrastructure could not handle their accommodation, which lessened the tensions between competition. 

A similar trend of competing for the profits from pilgrims can also be observed in the region around Ōyama, where in the latter part of the eighteenth-century quarrels arose over packhorse fares and lodgings of pilgrims (Nenzi 2004, 308). By 1840 local inn and village leaders made an agreement to resolve the issues of lost profit from pilgrims by lowering ferry fares and elimination of regional tolls, which had been causing travelers to choose alternate routes. "These official ordinances and self-imposed codes of conduct intended to regulate the proliferation of traffic indicate the growing complexity of the space of travel and the increasing weight of consumer logic" (ibid, 309). The importance of this consumer logic surrounding pilgrimage is also noticed by other historians, as Ambros (2008) as she observes how providers of services and goods catered to the growing desires of pilgrims, which fueled the regional economy and over time these regions came to rely on Ōyama pilgrimage.

Likewise in other areas of Japan, religious institutions worked with the local region to promote pilgrimage. Thal's research (2005) into the Konpira religious site in Northern Shikoku, a destination which rivaled Ise in popularity, shows that the growth of this site was not due to its religious significance alone; it relied on business owners as much as it did on the priests, and the popularity of this location developed in tandem with the surrounding markets and entertainment. In order to raise income as well as the religious status of the shrine,"[t]he priests of Konpira, like priests of other would be pilgrimage sites, simultaneously developed the attractions of both the god and the town to boost the economic viability of the sacred domain" (ibid, 3), holding lavish festivals and parades which they times with events in the nearby town. A similar phenomenon that was common to many pilgrimage sites of Japan and around the world, the Konpira religious complex "grew amid a bustling pilgrimage economy of entertainments and commerce: performances, prostitution, and gambling proved as integral to the growth of the sites as amulets and worship" (ibid, 3). 

The importance of the mixing of religious and worldly elements is reflected in how Konpira rewarded regional lords in exchange for their patronage by offering social benefits that "legitimized, protected, and enhanced" their prestige (ibid, 76). Thal describes how the support of three nearby daimyo mutually benefited all parties, "weaving the sacred domain of Konpira - oustide the formal boundaries of any of the three larger domains - into an expanding network of personal, economic, and ritual relationships" (ibid, 78). The religious popularity of the Konpira site, which was fueled by the pilgrims who traveled to it, was of importance to these daimyo, affecting their social and economic power. "The development of a widespread pilgrimage culture in the nineteenth century both relied upon and enabled the growth of economic networks of consumption, advertising, and offerings" (ibid, 98). As these networks grew, they contributed to the growth and development of the economy, society, and "a multifaceted culture in which the gods play an integral part" (ibid). 

### Section conclusion (Ishimori, Seaton)
These examples demonstrate how important the economic potential of pilgrimage of the Edo period came to be for the community's business as well as its shrines and temples. It greatly affected the regional landscape, with existing towns flourishing, and new towns forming around popular shrines and temples, both due to the direct results of pilgrimage (Ishimori 2009). In turn, the popularity of a religious site could offer social benefits in exchange for the patronage of regional lords. The economic significance of pilgrimage would therefore not be dismissed by the bakufu or daimyo just because the peasant was responsible for the land crops. Despite Vaporis arguing that the authorities viewed the peasant as someone who should stay tied to their land, catering to these pilgrims "by providing food, lodging, and entertainment at religious sites was the foundation of much of the modern Japanese tourism industry" (Seaton et al 2017, 20). 

While it is arguable that the above cases of conflict over competition of pilgrims reveals a neutral action of the authorities towards pilgrimage, it shows their priority of keeping order and responding to the needs of the community. In order to asses their disposition towards pilgrimage more definitively, however, it is necessary to review other cases of their involvement with pilgrimage where they show positive and negative reactions. 

## Authorities Response to Pilgrimage

### Ōyama Cult (Ambros)
#Ambros_2008
In Ambros's research (2008) of the Ōyama pilgrimage, she argues that the reaction of the bakufu toward pilgrimage depended on how exactly that pilgrimage was conducted. In looking at the make-up of Ōyama pilgrims, for example, she observes that they were largely from confraternities, where the members "pooled their funds to finance the pilgrimage, and therefore the pilgrims were not a burden on communities along the route but fueled the regional economy" (ibid, 16). The pilgrimages also usually took place before harvest, sending only a select few members of the community and thus village life was not disrupted. In addition, these pilgrimages were not for the sake of a single individual, but undertaken on behalf of the entire community, as the pilgrims would bring back amulets for everyone. These community-building aspects pilgrimage reinforced social harmony, therefore, the bakufu were not against it. "The few regulations that pertained to it were not so much meant to limit the pilgrimage to Ōyama but more to ensure that pilgrims did not extend their pilgrimages unduly and maintained order on their journeys" (ibid, 173). 

In contrast to the bakufu's support of Ōyama pilgrimages, Ambros points out that they outlawed confraternities of Mt. Fuji a number of times during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But the reasons behind their actions have been argued be because of how the Fuji cult was managed and how its members acted. As Tyler (1981) explains, this was a new religion without any connection to an established sect and therefore illegal by definition. In addition, the cult had troublesome practices, such as were frequently refusing to provide sick pilgrims with any other medication besides the holy water from Fuji, and chanting while handing out talismans outside people's gates. Finally, because the devotees were a mingling of commoners and samurai, the bakufu were concerned with potential subversion. In other words, it was not because the bakufu sought to curb tourism, but because this specific sect was seen as problematic for the region and socially disruptive. 

### Nukemairi (Ambros, Vaporis)
Another type of pilgrimage that was seen as problematic was the *nukemairi*, the absconding pilgrimage taken without permission (Ambros 2008). This type of unauthorized pilgrimage was one that garnered opposition from the pilgrim's communities as well as the authorities, and was seen as selfish and an inconvenience to one's family and master. The Osaka City Magistrate thus prohibited *nukemairi* because it was threat to civil peace. Pilgrims were "without discretion, simply dropping what they were doing and leaving home, neglecting to shut doors or put out fires" (Vaporis 1994, 207). There were also instances where *nukemairi* pilgrims left infants and elderly unattended, and a case of too many apprentices suddenly leaving and causing a labor shortage. The authorities, therefore, deemed *nukemairi* to be causing harm to the region and its economy and thus discouraged it. Perhaps this is why it is often referenced when historians (such as Blacker and Goree) comment about the authorities' strictness of pilgrimage, as Ambros points out that the *nukemairi* type of pilgrim is "partially responsible for the pervasive view of pilgrimage in the early modern period as a disorganized and even subversive activity" (2008, 145). While there are clearly community concerns surrounding *nukemairi* pilgrims, being against it is not the same as being against pilgrimage and travel in general. While not making this statement specifically, in Vaporis's observation of the large spectrum of regulations instituted by the bakufu, he does note how they try to make applying for a permit easier in order to counter *nukemairi*. For example, the changes by the Kaga domain appeared to be reactionary as they attempted to make the permit application process more simple. Vaporis reasons that "[t]his was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them" ( #Vaporis_1994, 173). Based on these observations, it is reasonable to argue that the intention behind the constraints that the authorities put on pilgrimage was to limit a pilgrim's potential negative repercussions on their home region.
### Tolerance in Shikoku (Kouame)
#Kouamé_1997
Another element responsible for the negative view of pilgrimage is the "solitary, mendicant pilgrims"(Ambros 2008, 145) who traveled around the Shikoku circuit pilgrimage of eighty-eight religious sites, a journey that often took a period of months. This pilgrimage was often undertaken by individuals or small groups who were not connected to religious associations or confraternities, unlike pilgrimages of Ise and Oyama who had religious institutions promoting and managing the pilgrim's travel directly. Ambros argues that this mendicancy was view by both bafuku and domainal authorities as disruptive and antisocial because they "perceived religious travel as a burden on the communities that hosted pilgrims as well as on the home communities left behind" (Ambros 2008, 146). The bakufu therefore instituted constraints to counter that burden, such as travel duration and route which must be taken. While these constrains are often referenced as cases where the authorities were more restrictive towards pilgrims (Vaporis 1994), it is important to realize that they were instituted in order to protect the region. Blacker (1984) uses this type of pilgrim in her argument that pilgrimage was used as a way of escaping the restrictiveness of Edo society: by cutting their moral ties and putting themselves outside vertical hierarchy, they gain the freedom much like the outcasts and divine wanderers. Traganou also argues that this liberation from social responsibilities and hierarchy that attracted pilgrims was seen by the bakufu as subversive and therefore posed a threat to the authority (Traganou 2004).

%%Blacker : "Carmen Blacker, for example, argues that the archetypal pilgrim is the mendicant ( yugyōsha), a wandering ascetic, who often appeared in art and literature throughout Japanese history. Blacker holds that temporary pilgrims who absconded to the Ise Shrines or traveled along the long circuit in Shikoku emulated the ideal of the solitary mendicant and turned to pilgrimage as a means of escape from the confines of the ordinary world, forsaking their community for an individualistic spiritual journey. During the early modern period, such mendicancy was regarded as antisocial and disruptive by bakufu and domainal authorities." Ambros  %%
#### Authorities Support for pilgrims
While there are certainly many constraints in the Shikoku circuit pilgrimage, when looking at the level of freedom that the authorities were granting pilgrims, Kouamé (1997) argues that the restrictiveness of the regulations were comparatively insignificant. Amidst the many rules of the was clear tolerance in an attempt to support a positive pilgrimage industry. Kouamé points out that while the authorities did try to closely regulate pilgrims and forbid the disorderly and disruptive elements of the pilgrimage, they also provided a system of support for those in need who followed the regulations"(ibid, 424). 

For example, in the case of a pilgrim's illness or death, they could depend on local officials to provide medical care, repatriation, or burial. Looking at how many pilgrims the authorities helped return to their home regions was "quite significant", Kouamé argues, and "[i]t is clear that such assistance was standard practice" (ibid, 423). It is also important to note that these regulations were laid down by the Tokugawa bakufu in the seventeenth century, so while the Shikoku authorities may have just been following the rules, even so they should not be analyzed in terms of only oppressive control, because it is clear that they also helped pilgrims in trouble (ibid, 421). 

There were, of course, punishment for violates of rules, such as denying the pilgrims entrance to a province. In one such instance in the early 1800s, two sick pilgrims who were undertaking the Shikoku pilgrimage in hopes of it curing their illness were denied entry into Tosa, the southern region of Shikoku. The authorities of Tosa are believed to have been the most severe towards pilgrims, but in looking closely at the situation of the region at this time, Kouamé observes that Tosa was experiencing a famine, and thus the authorities were likely trying to prevent the sick pilgrims, who they feared might stay in the province beyond their allotted time, from becoming a burden to the locals (ibid, 418). This example demonstrates that the background of the situation surrounding actions taken against pilgrims needs careful consideration, because the caution exercised by the Tosa authorities may be not a reflection of their position against pilgrimage, but against specific cases of negative regional repercussions or antisocial elements. 

However, Kouamé argues that even in such cases where those antisocial elements existed, it appears "to have had no influence on the general attitudes of local authorities towards common pilgrims" (1997, 419). In all the historical materials of the dysfunctional aspects of the Shikoku pilgrimage, Kouamé advices caution. "To infer from them that pilgrims of this sort were numerous and dangerous to the social order could well be erroneous" (ibid, 420), because while a bureaucracy's does not note the cases where everything is in order. Kouamé concludes that the response to the Shikoku pilgrimage "reveals that the political authorities of the latter Tokugawa period were tolerant regarding the mobility of the ordinary populace" (ibid, 143). The strictness of the Shikoku authorities can be arguably their response to a particularly problematic  pilgrimage. 

### Section conclusion 
While some historians may use the Shikoku circuit pilgrimage or the *nukemairi* pilgrims as an example of the bakufu's opposition of pilgrimage, upon closer examination it provides evidence of bakufu's support of the pilgrims during their journey. As the cases above reveal, the bakufu was clearly not against all pilgrimage; how the pilgrimage was conducted and how it affected the local region appears to be a deciding factor on whether the authorities supported or prohibited it. Furthermore, from their reaction it is evident that they prioritized keeping the economic effects of the pilgrimage industry positive. 
This focus of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity is also reflected in how the authorities restructured and managed the rice tax, as argued in Hall (2022). #Hall_2022 The bakufu was focused on keeping a balanced rice market and growing yields, and to that end they intentionally left a surplus of rice with the peasants; this reveals their underlying economic motivations and how they governed with a degree of benevolence. Much like their actions regarding the rice tax, if the pilgrimage of the peasants had a positive economic impact, and as long as that travel did not hinder the crop yields, both the bakufu and regional daimyo would be inclined to allow it, making rules to keep in within the confines that prevented economic harm to the region. Such a position would be more beneficial than to spend more effort and money into micromanaging the travel of the lower class. The constraints instituted toward pilgrimage were perhaps an attempt to make the system more suitable in response to the needs of the people, instead of trying to control what the people needed. While Vaporis mentions similar observations, commenting on how the regulations dealing with pilgrimage have to do with negative economic effects, he fails to make a statement regarding the positive economic effects that the many pilgrims brought. 

The above research demonstrates an acceptance of pilgrimage and the priority of economic prosperity; however, the question of why still remains. I argue that reason behind the bakufu's reaction is a result of the changing style of governance of the Tokugawa bakufu and daimyo, a reflection of the changing political landscape. To understand this connection, it is necessary to look at the beginning of the Tokugawa period when the society changes unfolded. 

## Tokugawa Governance
The image of Tokugawa bakufu is often portrayed as authoritarian, restricting both physical and financial freedom (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REF</mark>). Contradiction of this image, there are also arguments that reveal a shift to prioritizing the economic prosperity of the common people as a result of the change of governance and social structure that followed Tokugawa's rise to shogunate. Among these changes is the adoption of Confucianist ideas, described by some historians as "benevolence" (Hall 1966). While #Gordon_2003 and #Tanimoto_2019  argue that the Confucian concept of benevolence was not popular in the seventeenth century, pointing out the authoritarian "squeezing of the peasants" for their own benefit, Tanimoto does at admit that there are some instances, such as civil engineering infrastructure, the economic interests of the authorities and the common people likely overlapped. However, looking deeper into the social and economical changes as Japan entered an era of peace reveals a complex society that no longer fits the translation of the feudalistic authoritarian (REF). 

### Bizen Daimyo (Hall)
 #Hall_1966
In the late seventeenth century as Tokugawa Ieyasu rose to power, he made many attempts to legitimize his position as shogun while destabilizing the daimyo to prevent any possible uprising. Despite his many efforts, including connecting his lineage to the imperial family and Minamoto line, he still remained politically precarious. To compensate for this, he worked to put in his direct control the most productive lands and commercial centers in order to strengthen the Tokugawa regime's economic power. This meant control of monetary and commercial policy, and access to the largest supplies of loan capital (Hall 1966). In addition, Tokugawa also had ownership of the largest mines of precious metals, which helped the ability to control currency. While Tokugawa's manpower may have been spread thin across all of Japan, as long as the country's economic and technological level "remained relatively unchanged, the Tokugawa [administration] could thus claim certain economic advantages which made possible their domination of national economic policy and the nationwide organs of exchange and transportation" (ibid, 358-359). This is one reason behind the bakuf's focus on the economy, and why they closely managed the rice market as revealed in Hall (2022). In addition to prioritizing economic power, Tokugawa also drew upon Confucian ethics and principles of social structure to justify the Tokugawa regime and its status-based legislation in the claim of benevolent governance (ibid).
%%However, this new approach to social organization created the need to devise a more rational basis and ideological foundation of one's rule. 
Thus the Tokugawa shoguns (and following their example the daimyo) drew upon the concepts from Confucianism, using its ethical values and principles of social structure in an attempt to justify their status-based legislation. %%
The changes that Tokugawa instituted in order to protect his hegemony, Hall argues, fundamentally transformed the "whole structure of society and the exercise of authority"; the relationships of society that had been "essentially vertical systems were being replaced by more generalized, horizontally defined, functional group relationships" (ibid, 392-393). In an effort to immobilize potential opposition to the Tokugawa regime, the daimyo were relocated and restructured. The bakufu conducted regular inspections of the daimyo, checking the domain's productivity, administration methods, financial resources, and the people's standards of living. No longer was the tenure of a family always hereditary and the confiscation of a daimyo's lands or transfer to a different region, which happened frequently, were usually "for lack of heir, mismanagement, infringement of the basic regulations of the shogunate, or, of course, as a sign of favor" (ibid 362). In addition, the samurai were taken from the villages and put to live in the castle towns, which greatly weakened the daimyo's direct connection to the villages. As a consequence of these changes, "the peasantry and other classes as well came to acquire a more uniform public identity ",  and the position of the daimyo shifted from "manorial lords or patriarchal superiors" to "rulers and officials" (ibid, 392). Hall argues that "Tokugawa government rested on the fundamental conception that society was composed of statuses, or estates, each with its particular function" (ibid, 369). Because these changes to social organization created the need to devise a more rational basis and ideological foundation of one's rule, both for the shogunate over the country and the daimyo over their region, the focus shifted to whether the ruler was fit to manage the subjects of the realm. Hall points out that "the successful daimyo after 1600 was one who learned to master the ethical-rational system of beliefs which supported his right to rule as a benevolent autocrat committed to the welfare of his subjects" (ibid, 393).

**Mitsumasa example**
As an example of this type of benevolent rule, Hall presents the Mitsumasa daimyo of the Bizen province, observing that the government was concerned with the well-being of the lower class. Hall argues that the style of government of the Bizen province, which lasted for two hundred years, provides "one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age" (ibid, 403). The principles of Mitsumasa's governance lay within the Confucian principles of benevolent authoritarianism. 

  "Mitsumasa built upon the foundations of military organization and civil administration which had been laid by his predecessors, filling out the body of codified injunctions and bureaucratic precedents. But he went further and added to his rule the indispensable ingredient of moral rationale" (ibid, 403).
In Hall's observation of the Bizen domain, he concludes that Mitsumasa's fame was due to how he adapted the Confucian ethical ideas to his governance and "persistently sought to regulate his own conduct by them".  In this way, the power of a ruler became linked more directly to the condition of the population within their realm, and this became closely connected to the economic potential they held. 

### Bakufu governance changes (Paramore)
This shift towards a socially responsive government is also recognized by Paramore (2012) in his research on the state academy and its examination system in the later half of the Tokugawa period.
Refuting the arguments that Neo-Confucian political concepts encouraged authoritarianism, Paramore argues that governmental changes were usually designed to open up the decision making process to more people, and can be seen as "an attempt to generate more socially engaged, inclusive, and responsive governance" (ibid, 27). This argument against the idea that the Tokugawa government was top-down and authoritarian. While Paramore's research looks at the later half of the Tokugawa period, there are concrete examples of bottom-up governance from the seventeenth century, observed by Roberts (1998) in his research on mercantilism in the Edo period. 

Nakai's research

### Tosa Daimyo (Roberts)
#Roberts_1998
In Roberts' research (1998) of the merchant thought during the Edo period, he observes that one way the government incorporated new ideas and policies into their administration was the use of petition boxes. "Petitioning in all forms was a major means of integrating the interests of the ruled and the rulers", by providing opinions outside of the governmental hierarchy while leaving the ultimate decision with the rulers (ibid, 132). These petition boxes were used by many of the domains, including Edo bakufu, and Roberts believes that their prevalence suggests a search for new ideas. From the incorporation of suggestions from the commoner, the mercantilist thought of *kokueki*, meaning "prosperity of the country", became embedded into the discourse of the samurai and ultimately the samurai adopted the *kokueki* thought into their discourse (ibid, 133).
As an example of this thought, among petitions where the term *kokueki* appears are calls for the encouraging tourism. Among these is one from a scabbard maker Zenpachi, who suggests, among other things, that the daimyo promote pilgrimage to a famous local temple. Zenpachi argues that if access into the region was made easier, that pilgrims would increase, and 'every year great amounts of foreign gold and silver would drop into the country, working eternally for the prosperity of the country and providing all of the people with a living'" (ibid, 142)." Roberts points out an important part of this petition is that in Zenpachi's many suggestions, none of them represent his personal economic interest and represents was "a way of understanding the economy and the lord's and people's roles within it" (ibid). This was inspired, Roberts argues, by the idea of *kokueki*. 

   "It is not inevitable that a scabbard maker should be so concerned with, as he says, 'thinking of ways in which to have foreign money drop into Tosa' [...] What was common to these and many other petitions was a vision of Tosa as a single economic unit, the welfare of which was dependent mainly upon commercial concerns - most often export industries - and cash flow within the domain" (ibid, 142).
   
Roberts observes that not all petitions were enacted, and often there was disagreement among townspeople on what should be suggested, therefore the interest of the samurai "in the economic potential of commerce and commercially inspired industry was mixed" (ibid ,149). Nevertheless, I would argue that these changes reflect how widespread mercantile thought was becoming in Edo period Japan, and how the interests of the lower classes could reach the ears of the rulers. Hall argues, therefore, that in the 1700's this  mercantilist thought of *kokueki* influenced the daimyo as they sought to reduce the the dominance of the economy of the Tokugawa shogunate. Thus the rhetoric of the the merchants found its way into domainal governance. 


## Conclusion

If the authorities were more concerned about economy and managing the country, it is understandable why they would not hinder pilgrimage and only lightly voice "unnecessary travel".


Following this, an examination of **how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry.** Using studies that look closely at the development of pilgrimage reveals that the economic potential of these travelers was realized by the shrine and temples *oshi*, who promoted and organized pilgrim's travel and organize travel for pilgrims (Kanzaki 1995). Their efforts resulted in the direct increase of pilgrims (Ambros 2008) and over time other local entities began to vie for the service of those travelers, creating a competitive market. This research emphasizes just how vital the tourism industry that emerged from pilgrimage came to be for many regions of Japan.

Exploring the political and socioeconomic dimensions of pilgrimage (Thal, Ambros, Nenzi) reveals that 

Looking at how authorities responded to this industry reveals that in many cases where communities take steps to allow and support pilgrimage travel they are met with positive responses from authorities (Ambros 2008, Kouamé 1997,  Thal 2005). In cases where the authorities attempt to restrict pilgrimage (Vaporis ?), the main factor in the authorities' actions appears to be for the purpose of limiting the negative economic effect of pilgrimage that it had towards the surrounding region. I argue that both of these cases reflect the authorities' concern with the economy; therefore they limit pilgrimage when it has negative affect on region and allowing it when the effect is positive or neutral. 

Finally, the reason why the **Tokugawa authorities were primarily concerned with the economy was due to their style of governance** which used Confucian ideals of benevolent rule and economic prosperity of the people in order to legitimize and strengthen the ruler's position. 

This can be traced back to the beginning of Edo period when they restructured the rice tax and prioritized agricultural development, which meant improving the quality of life for the commoners. 
research of Tokugawa bakufu and daimyo governance reveals a trend of 


moving away from authoritarian methods and prioritizing the welfare of the people. As the entire tax system was based on the efforts of the farmer, this would result in their own prosperity.

This argument is support by research that reveals the bottom-up style of governance that looks more democratic than authoritarian (Paramore 2012), and research that shows benevolent ruling was becoming more common and linked to a region's prosperity (Hall 1966). While Hall's research might argue that the basis for this style of governance was largely based in Confucianism, another possibility is that it simply was more economically rewarding for the rulers. As my previous research on the rice tax revealed, the bakufu saw it in their own wellbeing to benevolently leave the peasants with a surplus, because it led to an overall increase in rice tax and an increase in other commodities. %%I believe this to represent their overall priority and interest in the economy.%%

From the findings of this research, I argue that the economic potential of pilgrimage, which was exploited by the religiously affiliated *oshi*, popularized by media and enhanced by the competition of regional businesses, was also understood by the bakufu a became a determining factor in how they, and subsequently the regional authorities, responded to pilgrimage. The tourism industry that was intertwined with pilgrimage was greatly important to the regions and therefore would also be important to the rulers, as it was in their best interest to ensure the region's economic prosperity.

"The early modern system was not unremittingly oppressive but gave many institutions opportunities to operate on their own terms by harnessing local and regional resources" (Ambros 2008, 239).

Kouamé "the case of Shikoku could provide an example of the degree of tolerance seen in an administration renowned for its severity and the degree of flexibility of a social system known for its rigidity" (ibid, 414). 

### Dichotomy of Pleasure & Religion a modern idea 
Finally, in addition to the bakufu's focus on economy and not micromanaging commoner's lives, another reason why pilgrimage was allowed to the extent it was is because pilgrimage for religious reasons and pleasure was intertwined in the Edo period. 
Our idea that pilgrims used pilgrimage as a pretense (or *tatemae*) under which they hid their real intent of pleasure travel (*honne*) is not an excuse to get around the bakufu's rules, as X has argued. Rather, it represents the fact that the pilgrimage consisted of both enjoyable sightseeing and religious worship, the separation of which is a modern phenomenon, as argued by Shinno. "The accounts seem to me to illustrate the inextricable conjoining of faith and pleasure that constituted the essence of the phenomenon of pilgrimage" (Shinno 2002, 469). 
"The modern dualistic ethic, with its positing of an opposition between the sacred and the profane, did not exist in that context. This was true also of travel" (ibid). 
To make an argument that the bakufu were fine with religious pilgrimage and not l

"There remains little debate about whether the sacred and profane blended in the act of pilgrimage" (Goree 2020, 19).


### Why this research is meaningful	
This research reveals not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, but also the shows the underlying motivations behind the bakufu and ruling authorities' actions and how they dealt with the lower classes. 
This research is important not just in understanding the motivations of the authorities, but emphasizes the economic value of pilgrimage as essential to understanding why travel became so prevalent among the Edo populace. 

%%These points are both vital to understanding what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan. %%
