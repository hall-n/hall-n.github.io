The main factors that drove travel in Tokugawa was agriculture and the growing economy
### Questions

Why did people travel?

- rite of passage
- increase experience, e.g. young unmarried women travelling with family members

- As restrictions in Edo society became greater, moving to the outside world by travel offered freedom. "not only does the pilgrim project the image of the holy wanderer to the outside world. His own motive in setting out on the journey likewise reflects something of the same pull which took the yugyosha out of the social order, of an escape from the world and everything it stands for into a state of detachment and blissful freedom from ties" Blacker 2008

Perhaps the restrictions urged more travel and backfired

- Barriers decreased

- sekisho or toll barriers were abolished by Nobuaga and new sekisho byTokugawa were erected. They didn’t hinder pilgrimage to shrines and weren't for the purpose of exacting tolls  (Blacker 2008)
- improved roads
- disappearance of pirates (blacker 2008)
- small affordable inns

- not enough to account for the desire to go on pilgrimages that were still "arduous, uncomfortable, expensive and often hazardous" Blacker 2008

How did villagers view travelers

- potential disguised divinities (blacker )

- settai, giving alms to pilgrims (blacker ) "Because the pilgrim might be Kobo Daishi in disguise."

- brings good fortune, or might invite curse

How did the Shogunate view travelers?
- "dirty and lazy dropouts, playing no useful part in proper human society" threat to order and stability (Blacker )
- negative view of leisure activities -> travel for religious reasons
- travel viewed by authorities as "frivolous, useless, extravagant and immoral." (blacker 2008)
- Economic

- neglecting duty and causing fall in production (blacker )
- money leaves domain, outflow of resources (Vaporis 1994)

- was negative view just for saving face?

How did authorities respond to the influx in travelers?

Did the Shogunate realize the ulterior motive? If so, did they care?

Why did the shogunate try to limit leisure and religious activities?

Did the shogunates response on limiting leisure travel act as the driving force for religious tourism?

Leisure and religion already linked

Did the temples and shrines tried to attract tourists?
- Grand festivals to raise money

Festivals
- pray for rain, so not just leisure activity
- "Festivals at shrines were frequently held during the busy farming season, as they functioned  as a leisure time to take a break from monotonous labor and prepare for a return to normal life." (朴 et al 2014)
