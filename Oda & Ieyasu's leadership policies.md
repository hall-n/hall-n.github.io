	Nobunaga's abolition of toll barriers (sekisho) and his expansion of the road system aided both the military and the merchant class that was taking shape in major cities. The merchants also benefited because the region that first came under Nobunaga's control, with the provinces of Mino, Ise, and Omi at the center, formed a ring of vital nodes in what was emerging as a national distribution network that linked the outlying provinces with the Kinai. Nobunaga also abolished the special privileges of the markets (ichi) and guilds (za) in the main cities in some areas, permitting what were called "free markets" (rakuichi) and "free guilds" (rakuza). **He guaranteed the merchants' freedom to travel and to conduct business without interference.** When the merchants came under his direct control, Nobunaga exempted them from the various imposts that had been exacted from them by different types of proprietary authorities such as court nobles, temples, shrines, and other warriors. These imposts included market taxes, business taxes, urban residential taxes, property taxes, and a variety of assessments that had to be given as "offerings of appreciation" in return for permission to conduct business. While Nobunaga sought to free merchants from such burdensome exactions, he also tried to concentrate commercial activity in the newly emerging castle towns. (Cambridge 57)

	Nobunaga's policies toward the guilds might seem inconsistent, as he abolished some and confirmed the rights of others. But this was done with a purpose. Rather than maintaining a system that relied on the extraction of small-scale cash income from individual merchants in the form of dues, and realizing that the territorial expansion of his authority required that the cities as a whole function as mechanisms for the conversion into cash of vast quantities of taxes collected in kind, he sought to make the cities the supply nodes for military equipment, firearms, ammunition, and the consumer goods needed for the daily lives of his retainers.
