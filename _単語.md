post station: shukueki
- "refer to both the station where the transpon services were offered and to the larger settlement of which it was sometimes a pan (referred to at times as shukubamachi. Both Japanese terms are used interchangeably, although the distinction is important in large, multi-functional settlements." Vaporis 1994

### Permits
sekisho transit permits (sekisho tegata)
- Sekisho transit permits were issued for passage through a particular sekisho. When stopping before the main office for inspection, the traveler handed over the permit and, if it was in order, went on his way. Such permits were issued by designated bakufu officials as well as daimyo and their officials. Vaporis 1994
- transit permits can be found from as early as the second decade of the seventeenth century

passports (orai tegata)
- Passports, on the other hand, could be used for as many sekisho and, in many cases, domain bansho, as the traveler passed through on his journey without surrendering it. Passports were issued by village and post station officials, shrines and temples, and sometimes even innkeepers. Vaporis 1994
- did not come into common use until the middle of the Edo period
