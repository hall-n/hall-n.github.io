#### positive community ties from pilgrimage
general,Ise confratcrnities also served as focal points for community life. In the Aizu area,however,they had a slightly different character.Unlike the typical community― bascd pilgrilnage― by― delegate confraternitics of the region,they had more the naturc of a voluntary group formed by people sharing the same faith.A

10 Pcople who safely com― pleted the lse pilgrimage together were called lsc brothers. They would continue to hold confraternity meetings in turns at each othcr's houses,and were seen as sharing a tie for life,in good tilncs and bad,a tie that was said to be closer than that with relatives and or even immediatc family.

#### Pleasure and religion intertwined in Edo period travel
These accounts of actual pilgrilnages lnightrnake one wonder:Were religion and faith a trivial lnatter for the general Japanese populacc?Could the pursuit of pleasure be the real reason behind their travels?Is this but another example of the often― mentioned religious inconstancy of the Japanese―
一who bow before
Buddhas and then take pilgril■ agcs to Shinto shrines?The actual situation is rather different,I think.The accounts secln to me to illustrate the inextricable COttOining offaith and pleasure that constituted the essence ofthe phenomenon of pilgrilnage.The modern view of religion tends to put a preclninent value on purity of faith and sees pleasure trips andjourneys of faith as two incompatible
opposites.To yield even a little to the desire for pleasure indicates a lack of seri― ousness,a corruption of faith.The place that incarnates such religious austerity
is the lse shrine of today,overflowing as itis with an aura of pu五 ty. In the past,however,the relationship between religion and pleasure trips(Or
sightseeing tours)was nOt necessarily seen in this light.One rnight even say that religion was One form ofe可oyment.Attending the meeting ofthe Nenbutsu con―
fraternity or the Kannon confraternity of one's village was not only an expres― sion of faith,but one of the great pleasures of life.The modern dualistic ethic, with its positing of an opposition between the sacred and the profanc,did not exist in that context.This was truc also of travel.We should not forget that for ordinary people the strict regulations hedging in travel meant that rcligion
offered almostthe only chance to satisfy their aspiration for tourism in the mOd― ern sense.This cxplains why many travel diaries record stops at famous scenic and historic sites along the way to the temples and shrines being visited.It
