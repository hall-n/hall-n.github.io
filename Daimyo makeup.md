Daimyo makeup
Cambridge 2008
	Although the shape of shogunal authority changed relatively little during the Muromachi period, the emerging daimyo domains underwent fundamental changes, especially in the strength and spread of the lord-vassal relationship that lay at the center of military house organization. From their early appearance as small military lordships in the Muromachi age, the incipient daimyo domains underwent a long process of evolution, changing shape in response to the different political environments that enveloped them. Modern historians have claimed to be able to identify four different types, or stages, of daimyo development, to which they have assigned the names shugo, sengoku, shokuho, and kinsei, each exhibiting progressively greater strength of control from the center.12 Daimyo rule exhibited many regional differences at the start. Hayami Akira makes a case for the existence of three regional zones of economic development: (i) the developed central Kinai region surrounding the capital city; (2) the middle fringe area surrounding Kinai, particularly the provinces of Omi and Mikawa; and (3) the Kantd, or eastern provinces.13 It was the middle fringe area that, being able to profit from

of higher forms of authority. Above the han was the Tokugawa bakufu, presided over by a shogun from whom every daimyo, or han chief, derived his legitimacy. One step beyond that again stood the emperor and his court, powerless in fact but nevertheless the symbolic fount of all authority, even that of the bakufu itself. Yet to most people living in the han - the farmers, craftsmen, shopkeepers, servants, day laborers, and fishermen - shogun and emperor would have been little more than abstractions, dimly perceived and of no immediate relevance. The samurai class, being both educated and traveled to an extent denied other sections of society, would have known of these more exalted bodies - would perhaps have had some degree of personal contact with one or other of them at some time - but for most of them, too, their han was paramount. 183
