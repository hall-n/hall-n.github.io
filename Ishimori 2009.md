*Ishimori 2009, Popularization and commercialization of tourism in early modern Japan*

##### Pilgrimage cost effort and money
Considering that the people who traveled outside their home country at that time must had to have a permit and a certificate, which functioned much like a present day passport, and they spent a large amount of money, such travels in the Edo period can be regarded as the overseas travel in the present day. 

##### Tourism started in  Genroku era (1688-1704)
Other historical sources also suggests that the popularization of tourism started in the Genroku era (1688-1704), and many people travelled for pleasure while nominally visiting shrines and temples for worship or visiting hot springs for healing illnesses. (181)

##### Tourism existed in Muromachi, but couldn't flourish because dangers and poor road
Travels for pleasure and worship were getting popular among the common people in the Kinki district, but the people living outside Kinki still could not afford to travel widely because of the unfavourable conditions for long distance travels. For instance, road networks were not developed and also accomModation facilities were not easily available, and travellers were often attacked by bandits and pirates. Moreover, civil wars in the late Muromachi period worsened the conditions for traveling, so that few people tried to travel for pleasure. (182)

##### Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1602) 
a result of abolition of the checkpoints al1 over the country, people were no longer levied heavy clearance fees, and long distance travels became easier and safer.

##### Early edo
In the early Edo period (early･ seventeenth century), conditions for the long distance travel were further improved. The road networks were highly developed and, accommodation facilities along roads provided meals, so that travellers no longer had to bring their own food. In addition, economic development leveled off regional differences and raised the economic standard of the common people, resulting in a nationwide traveling boom. (182)

##### Limited movement for government safety reasons
However, there still existed very strict restrictions on travel, because freedom of movement was not allowed for the people under the feudal system. All the travellers inebitably necessitated to ･pQssess "brai kitte" (traMc stamp) and "sekisho tegata" (checkpoint pass) while travelling. People was not permitted to leave their place of residence and to travel without such passport-like cenificates. The traMc stamp was a kind of identification card issued under the joint signature of the monk of the temple to which the one belonged and a landowner or a village chief. The checkpoint pass was issued by the fedual lord or the governmental magistrates, and was necessary for passing through the checkpoints. Women leaving Edo (Tokyo) were especially required to carry a checkpoint pass with detailed specifications. As the proverb, "Incoming guns and outgoing women" suggests, the Tokugawa government severely prevented the womenfolk of lords from leaving. (182)
the capital for their home provinces. They were a kind of hostage for the central government and were obliged to reside in Edo in order to prevent uprising against the government. The Tokugawa government also was very keen to prevent the importation of weapons into the capital since they were liable to be used for rebellions. (183)

##### Officials couldn't refuse medical and worshiping permit applications
All kinds of travel required permission in the form of traffic stamps and checkpoipt passes, and if the purpose of a travel was simply for pleasure or sightseeing, it was certainly not permitted. However, there are at least two exceptional cases for the common people to be allowed to travel a long distance. They were travel to shrines and temples for worship, and to hot springs for healing illnesses. The applications for long distance travel were submitted nominally under these headings, even though the actual purpose were just for pleasure and sightseeing. Visiting shrines and temples for religious worship, and visiting hot springs for medical treatment were so rea'sonable and persuasive that no governMent oMcials could refuse these applications, notwithstanding that the actual purpose were just for pleasure and sightseeing. (183)

##### Inns serving food helped tourism grow
In the middle of the Edo period inns began to serve meals for the first time. It was a radical change for the traveler since they no longer needed to bring any food. The introduction of meal service at inns contributed the development of travel for pleasure. The introduction of serving meals at inns inevitablly entailed the development of prostitution which was one of the important aspects of tourism. Every "shukuba" (station) had some brothels, and many male travelers visited there for female attraction. 

##### Goverment abloshed brothels at inns to control morals, but doesn't mention tourism
In the second year of Manji era (1659), the government decided to abolish the brothels at "shukuba" in order to control of people's morals. Since (184)
that time, waitresses at inns played a very important role not only in serving meals but also in serving as night mates for male customers [MiyAMoTo 1965]. The availability of such services at inns was most welcomed by many male travelers in non-ordinary playful setting. Iri the Genroku era the numbers of these waitresses greatly increased in accordance with the booming of tourism. The prevalence of prostitution at "shukuba" (station) by waitresses naturally brought controls by the police in .the third year of Kyoho (1718). 'The government proclaimed that the number of the waitresses should be limited to 2 persons per inn. (185)
