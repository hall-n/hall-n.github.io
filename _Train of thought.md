Bakufu keeping peasants tied to land (Vaporis)

The idea that keeping groups segregated is viewed negatively (Marxist thinking influence?)

But uprisings by peasants were not to remove the class distinctions but for actors to properly play their role (benevolent ruler)

Neither bakufu nor peasant seemed to try to change class distinctions, but that doesn't mean the bakufu removed the peasants freedom of movement

As long as it did not negatively affect farm production, what reason would they have to stop peasants from traveling?
