Bakufu keeping peasants tied to land (Vaporis)

The idea that keeping groups segregated is viewed negatively (Marxist thinking influence?)

Peasants not against class sytstem
- uprisings by peasants were not to remove the class distinctions but for actors to properly play their role (benevolent ruler)

Neither bakufu nor peasant seemed to try to change class distinctions, but that doesn't mean the bakufu removed the peasants freedom of movement

As long as it did not negatively affect farm production, what reason would they have to stop peasants from traveling?

Perhaps the reason for questioning the apperant laxity of the authorities is because of a different social approach, soft rules instead of hard rules, so they can bend to fit the variety of situations.
