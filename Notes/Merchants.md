### *Langrill 2012, The evolution of merchant moral thought in Tokugaw*
The Tokugawa Era of Japan is known for its domination by the shogunate, or warrior bureaucracy. While samurai capture the popular imagination, the merchant class of this era was changing their cultural narrative as well. The regime, officially Neo-Confucian, considered trade a vulgar and corrupting activity, but among commoners, especially in Osaka, a culture arose celebrating the virtue of commerce. Merchant scholars and commoners assailed the orthodoxy by putting forth alternate interpretations of Confucianism, and later by abandoning the entire Confucian framework. Their primary goal was to explore the nature of virtue and commerce, and justify their own place in the world. As a side effect, the marriage of virtue to commerce allowed a nexus of long-term relationships to arise, based in Osaka.

The scholars of the Kaitokudo- taught children and adults regardless of wealth, and a number of them wrote handbooks for children.

The books taught that risk taking was a necessary part of life in business, and losses are part of the nature of participating in the market

The Handa merchants were not unique; Najita (ibid, p. 25) was ‘convinced that commoners writing for commoners was not just an urban phenomenon but one that joined town and country in a shared discourse.’ The ubiquity of handbooks, which commoners in small groups read together and discussed, lends support to the image of Tokugawa commoners as active participants in shaping their own worldview

The general lines of the story of the merchant class before I868, whose 'rise' was chiefly economic and cultural, rather than political, are fairly well known among students of Japan. 193

unknowing agent of economic forces which, although they did not bring down the feudal system, did much to weaken the position of the Tokugawa regime.

It would appear that throughout the period, the vast majority of
Tokugawa merchants were fairly well satisfied with the status quo, and one looks in vain for revolutionaries among them. There was a modest attempt by scholarly writers, including merchant writers, to justify trade and reasonable profits, as contributing to the general welfare. But any expectation that merchant scholars would have striven for the enhancement of commerce is not fulfilled. They made no attempt to glorify trade or to claim a more realistic (i.e., higher) place in society for the merchant class. Rather, they tried to harmonize commerce and the merchants within the feudal system, and to make the merchants (200) satisfied with the social structure as it was. (201)

Also, there was a continued trend towards a retreat by the feudal lords from freer trade, and mercantilistic efforts to ship goods out, prohibit certain imports, and bring money into the various feudal domains ultimately became self-defeating and inhibited the further expansion of commerce. 202

In this way it can be said that the money economy controlled by the merchants, who without doubt were quite unaware of any responsibility, contributed to the fall of the Shoguns. 203
