Dedicated to the sun goddess Amaterasu, the ancient shrine drew hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually and many more during pilgrimages of thanksgiving (okagemairi)—the periodic mass pilgrimages that took place after particularly bountiful harvests starting in 1638. In 1830, one such pilgrimage swelled to an estimated five million people, including large numbers of women and children under the age of sixteen.28 The overlapping phenomenon of fleeing to Ise shrine without permission (nukemairi)—when pilgrims spontaneously left behind home, work, and duty to make the trek—also helps account for the large number of people traveling regardless of age, gender, or social status.
economic leeway for farmers and lower class, combined with relative freedom drove their travel.
In contrast, the samurai were more restricted by the bakufu. But as long as one gained a shrine visit permit, a peasant could easily travel.
This freedom of finances and movement, along with motivations from temple's advertisement and popular media like poems and images pushed travel interest. 
###### onshi, oshi:
"Itinerant proselytizers representing specific temples and shrines (called onshi in the case of Ise Shrine and oshi for other sites) made the rounds of villages and cities in the winter off-season to support confraternities and recruit new pilgrims—another crucial factor in the popularity of pilgrimage in the period."

##### *Gordon 2003 Modern History*
"despite many restrictions on what people in each status group were allowed to do, the Tokugawa did not micromanage the lives of ordinary people. Within the confines of a circumscribed world, commoners had considerable autonomy. It is true they needed permission to travel and were not supposed to move to cities. But enforcement of such rules was often quite lax. In practice, the bakufu and domain governments kept out of the internal affairs of villages, as long as the villagers paid their taxes." 16

Both these cities, and the roads between them, teemed with life….The country is populous beyond expression, and one would scarce think it possible, that being no greater than it is, it should nevertheless maintain and support such a vast number of inhabitants. The highways are in almost continuous rows of villages and boroughs: you scarce come out of one, but you enter another; and you may travel many miles, as it were, without knowing it to be composed of many villages. 21

Inspectors periodically investigated the highways, and in general the roads appear to have been maintained in satisfactory condition, though mountain stretches commonly were treacherous and secondary roads inferior. 239

Finally, governments too developed rules to cope with scarcity, most pervasively through sumptuary regulations. Originally the bakufu issued a few to give outward expression to shinokosho status distinctions by stipulating restrictions on residence style and scale, clothing, ornaments, and conduct. As scarcities became more pronounced late in the seventeenth century, however, sumptuary regulations multiplied like topsy. Legitimized by being embedded in the status order, they strove to regulate consumption of all manner of forest products, foodstuffs, metals, clothing, and myriad other items, thereby allocating scarce resources to status groups in proportions acceptable to the rulers. Even labor time became an object of attention as decrees sought to discourage recreation, inessential travel, and other "unproductive" uses of time. 265

"Kaempfer [1906, 2: 330], for example, wrote bf the "great numbers of people, who daily travel on the roads" and said that it was "owing partly to the Country's being extremely populous, partly to the frequent journies, which the natives undertake, oftener than perhaps any other nation, either willingly and out of their free choice, or because they are necessitated to it" 25
"Kaempfer [1906, 2: 35] noted early on that the Japanese were "very much addicted to Pilgrimage." 25
"urbanization and the redistribution of labor through migration" 25 were also reasons for travel/movement

##### What is Tourism?
"Cohen defines a tourist as "a voluntary, temporary traveler, traveling in the expectation of pleasure from the novelty and change experienced on a relatively long and non-recurrent round-trip.""31

##### Against  tourism
"Government did not recognize the concept of tourism, and therefore discouraged all recreational or touristic travel. In Kaga (1708), for example, residents in rural areas were told that: "Sightseeing or the making of pilgrimages to temples in Kanazawa is of no worth (may6). The same is all the more true for long-distance travel."3) But because domains were more tolerant of pilgrimage to Ise, for many the trip there, whether officially sanctioned or not, became an excuse to travel" 32-33
"In the face of widespread flouting of the permit process and violations on bans on pilgrimage, domains seemed at a loss as to what to do." 33
Often don't actually go to Ise or only visit outer shrine

##### Similar to modern tourism
"While quite characteristic of modern tourism, it appears that Tokugawa tourists just as well could be more concerned or involved with "on-site markers"--for example, placards, plans, appropriate souvenirs--than the site,s themselves, "as though they were checking off a list of having truly visited the approved sights by the mere recognition of their markers" [GRABuRN 1983: 46] ." 34
"Yamamoto Mitsumasa's study of travel diaries shows that pilgrims tended to .follow set itineraries when sightseeing in Edo," 34
"For Kita and Yaji of Hizakurige. as well as the large number of named and anonymous travel diarists, it was as much the pleasures of the trip, the local delicacies, the entertainments, even the women, that made the trip worthwhile." 24
"For some stations (like Akasaka or Mishima), the prostitutes appear to have been the main attraction that drew travelers. As a bakiofu oMcial, Tanaka Kyagu, declared, "Those stations with them [i.e., prostitutes] prosper, those without them fall into economic decline."" 35
"Post stations and urban centers all had specialty products (meibutsu)-natural and cultural products as well as religious talismans-that provided nourishment to travelers or served as souvenirs and gifts." 35

*Vaporis 2012 Linking the Realm: The Gokaidô Highway Network in Early Modern Japan*
(In "Highways, Byways, and Road Systems")
Tokugawa authority was also reflected by, and asserted through, the creation of a centralized road network, the Gokaidô (Figure 4.1), which was built at local expense and ran through the heart of the country, infringing on the sovereignty of those lords through whose territories it coursed. Central authority was further exercised through corvée labor requirements on the residents of those domains through which the roads passed; they were required to transport Tokugawa officials and cargo, thereby infringing on the daimyo’s right or ability to tax the people in their own domains (Vaporis 1986). 90-91

Even outside of the system of alternate attendance, samurai could not move

freely without the permission of their overlords, and usually their movements were in performance of duties to their daimyo overlord. Occasionally, they were given permission to travel for personal study and training in the martial arts. Some domains, however, banned outright recreational travel for them, and only in very rare cases were they given permission to travel to therapeutic hot springs. 93
...
All of this movement was only made possible by the elimination of many of the impediments to physical mobility that existed prior to the Tokugawa period, such as political fragmentation, warfare, social instability, mountain bandits, and the proliferation of economic tolls 93
...
A central aim of its policy was to keep traffic flowing, and the shogunate tried to achieve this by nationalizing the central road system, the Gokaidô, by abolishing private barriers or tolls, and by promulgating regulations that prohibited and discouraged the disruption of transport services.95

Tokugawa and their fellow daimyo idealized a society where most of the population remained tied to the land 98
