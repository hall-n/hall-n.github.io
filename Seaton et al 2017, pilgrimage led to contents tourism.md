##### March's review of *Contents tourism in Japan: pilgrimages to ‘sacred sites’ of popular culture*
Contents tourism is defined as travel behaviour motivated fully or partly by narratives, characters, locations and other creative elements of popular culture forms, including film, television dramas, manga, anime, novels and computer games. The concept has deep historical roots in Japan at the intersection of tourism, pilgrimage and popular culture. Pilgrimage dating back to the eighth century is identified as the earliest example of contents tourism. Contents tourism is defined by the motivation of the tourist not by the destination. Even a nondescript place captured in a narrative can become a popular destination with emotional pulling power.
