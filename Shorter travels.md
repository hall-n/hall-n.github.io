Travel to close areas, avoid barriers ^733040

*Goree 2020, The Culture of Travel in Edo*
	Shorter outings were an option when lengthy pilgrimages proved unfeasible. Reachable within days rather than weeks and requiring much less expense and planning, popular pilgrimage destinations within striking distance of Edo included Shinshō-ji temple on Mount Narita to the east, Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō to the north, the thirty-four temples associated with Kannon in Chichibu to the northwest, and Mount Ōyama and the shrine to Benzaiten on the small island Enoshima to the southwest. Women gravitated to these relatively nearby places because they did not require passage through barrier stations, in particular the Hakone checkpoint, which stood as a carefully policed gateway to the major pilgrimages further west.36 Much shorter trips taken within and around cities also grew popular. In Edo, day-trippers visited the one hundred Konpira sub-shrines linked to the main shrine on Shikoku or miniature replicas of Mount Fuji, which female members of the popular Mount Fuji cult climbed as a substitute for summiting the real mountain, which they were prohibited to do. 7
