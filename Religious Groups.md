Lack of bakufu's funding prompts support from shrine visitors ^9a79a9

competitive age
	Growing trade fostered fierce competition - among priests and diamyo seeking prosperity for their domains, among producers and merchants seeking lucrative contracts, among religious rivals seeking the donations and prayer commissions of would-be worshippers. The god Konpira became both resource and benefactor, as people sought to build and capitalize upon the pilgrimage at the same time that they prayed to the god for health and wealth. Amid these market forces, Mt. Zozu grew from a center of local trade to become an important link among the emerging entrepreneurial elites of western Japan. By the mid-eighteenth century, Konkoin's priests would obtain national recognition and economic security as the imperially sponsored, the exclusive site of a redefined Konpira. The object of prayers from people across the social and economic spectrum, Konpira became for many a god of money, symbolically as well as miraculously powerful in the increasingly fierce competition of a market-oriented age.
