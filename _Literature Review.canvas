The rise of the samurai marked an important stage in the transition from the increasingly ineffectual shoen system to the social institutions of Tokugawa society. **The gap between the upper-class farmers and the rest of the farming population was both a product of traditional social custom and a consequence of economic privileges and laws favorable to the elite rural families**. Fertilization with night soil has often been viewed as a hallmark of Japanese agriculture.","x":-400,"y":-640,"width":520,"height":420}
