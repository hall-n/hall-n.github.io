Strict with punishments for samurai, while lax for commoners ^6bbd61

The application of Tokugawa law was at times unpredictable and random, but it could also be flexible, for it was a traditional principle in Japanese law that reason should prevail over custom and precedent Vaporis 1994, 179

Commoners evaded sekisho, it seems, without great concern about possible punishment, implying that the authorities gave tacit approval of the short-cuts or that punishment was rarely exacted Vaporis 1994, 191

Sekisho were concerned primarily with the movement of people-particularly women-out ofEdo, contributing perhaps to the laxity with which other offenders were treated. Status was also a factor; while there are only two cases of samurai committing a sekisho-related offense, in both instances the samurai were made to suffer the death penalty. These cases, compared with those of commoners, emphasize the great distance that government maintained between status groups. Vaporis 1994, 181

regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control…There were limits to what the state could do to prohibit pilgrimage, which was widely accepted in society as a sacred act, and the evidence shows that the control measures instituted were generally ineffective. … 
**Perhaps the most common restrictions on any long-distance travel had to do with timing**. Since travel during the agricultural season would take a peasant away from the land, in theory decreasing the agricultural output of a village, long-distance travel was generally restricted to the agricultural off-season, after taxes had been collected. (Vaporis 198)
