What is Oyama?
a medieval yamabushi site that was understood as an earthly manifestation of Maitreya’s Tus.ita Heaven, changing into a complex Shingon academy and popular pilgrimage site in the early modern period.

Chapter 2 & 3: Ōyama’s institutional complexities. 
	A typical premodern cultic site, Ōyama presented an integrated mixture of traditions that were inseparable but not always entirely harmonious. Ōyama comprised Buddhist, Shinto, yamabushi, and oshi institutions of various sectarian affiliations.
	.... the Shingon Buddhist clergy assumed control over Ōyama, maintained its hold over this sacred site, and simultaneously turned it into a major regional Kogi Shingon academy. As a regional Shingon academy that was necessary to train clerics for the growing number of temples established by the temple registration system of early modern Japan, Ōyama was able to become a leader in a regional network of Kogi Shingon temples even though it had few branch temples of its own. As a sacred site, Ōyama was controlled institutionally and ritually by the Shingon clergy, whose twentyplus subtemples on the mountain cooperated in the administration of the site, led by the abbot of Hachidaibō, its main Shingon temple. 
	... The growing popularity of the site and the influx of pilgrims enhanced the Shingon temples’ wealth but also created rifts among them. These factors contributed to the gradual weakening of the Hachidaibō abbots’ control over the site. (14)
**Need of funds**
		Until the end of the seventeenth century, Ōyama’s institutions relied largely on significant donations by the shogunate, but from the early eighteenth century, when such donations were becoming less plentiful, Ōyama’s institutions were financed by direct donations from the population of the Kantō region. (55)

Chapter 3: the development of the oshi system at Ōyama
	In the first half of the seventeenth century, the oshi, managed large parishes of devotees throughout the Kantō region. By the nineteenth century, about 160 oshi were administering one million parish households across the entire Kantō-Tōkai region with an average of about 6,000 households per oshi. Some of the most powerful oshi had as many as 12,000 parishioner families. These parishes were different from those of Buddhist temples in the temple registration system, which might ideally have had one hundred to a thousand parish households with obligatory ties to the temple through the performance of funerary and memorial rites. **Instead of providing funerary rites, oshi distributed amulets and collected yearly donations from their parishioners, housing them in inns at Ōyama when they came on pilgrimage.** In order to lessen competition from inns in nearby villages, Ōyama’s oshi were specially licensed by the local Shingon clergy at Ōyama, but in the early nineteenth century many oshi began to seek additional Shinto licenses from the Shirakawa house, a sacerdotal lineage associated with the imperial court in Kyoto. These Shirakawa licenses, together with a growing interest in national learning among the oshi, became important factors in the disassociation of kami and Buddhas in the Meiji period. (15)

Chapter 4: the development of the pilgrimage to Ōyama
	how Ōyama’s ritual specialists, clergy and the oshi, jointly **managed the pilgrimage cult**, which became centered on the summer festival: The clergy officiated at rituals within the Buddhist precinct, i.e., Ōyama’s principal cultic sites, whereas the oshi lodged pilgrims, acted as intermediaries between pilgrims and clerics, and maintained active relationships with their parishioners through parish rounds to distribute amulets and collect first-fruit donations. By the early nineteenth century, Ōyama had become a highly complex and active site whose influence extended across the entire Kantō region. The Ōyama cult had successfully adapted its economy from one based primarily on state patronage during the medieval period to one based on the donations from a broad social base—its parishioners in villages and urban areas. (15)
**Key players in growing pilgrimage popularity**
		The oshi were the key players in Ōyama’s early modern transformation into a highly popular pilgrimage destination and again in Ōyama’s transformation from a Buddhist into a Shinto site during the early Meiji period. (84)
		At many sites, including the Ise Shrines, Mt. Fuji, Mt. Haruna, Enoshima, Mt. Mitake, and Ōyama, they were called oshi— pronounced onshi at Ise—which literally means “venerable master” and originally appears to be short for kitōshi (prayer master). In the midHeian period, the term oshi was first used at Buddhist temples and later at shrine-temple multiplexes near the capital, such as the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine.4 Subsequently, the oshi associated with the Ise and Kumano Shrines developed into a distinct category of religious specialist beginning in the late-Heian and medieval periods. **By the early modern period, oshi had become indispensable because they contributed to the growth of pilgrimage cults.** Ōyama was one such regional pilgrimage site at which a complex oshi system developed from yamabushi and shrine priests during the early modern period. 
		Ōyama’s oshi, who descended from its medieval yamabushi and shrine priests, as well as local artisans and merchants, gradually developed into a distinct form of religious professional in the early modern period. (85)
		Ōyama owed its popularity to its oshi, who developed parishes in the Kantō region. Beginning in the late seventeenth century, the oshi expanded the mountain’s most important asset—customary parishioners. Using similar methods as the Ise onshi, the Ōyama oshi made rounds to their parishioners to collect first-fruit donations (hatsuho)— originally, the first harvested crops, this later became an equivalent amount in cash. The Ōyama oshi, like their Ise counterparts, also distributed gifts and amulets and **provided housing for pilgrims who came to Ōyama**. The oshi were usually not celibate and passed their profession and parishes on to their heirs, just as merchants, artisans, or performers would pass on their family trade. 
		As in the case of Ise, the expanding number of Ōyama oshi reflects a pattern of growth until the mid-eighteenth century, which then leveled off until the mid-nineteenth century. These fluctuations are more a reflection of the increasing professionalization of the oshi rather than of a decline in Ōyama’s popularity. The oshi entered into a symbiotic relationship with the Shingon clergy, who guaranteed their status when faced with competitors. To limit the pool of contenders eligible to become oshi and thus curb the competition among them, **the Shingon clergy provided the oshi with licenses that distinguished those living in Ōyama’s monzenmachi from residents of neighboring villages keen on sharing the profits of a growing pilgrimage industry.** In return, the oshi served as liaisons between pilgrims and the Shingon Buddhist clergy on the mountain. The Shingon clergy also employed a number of villagers for the administration of Ōyama and for the performance of certain ritual functions, which contributed to status distinctions between the oshi.(86)

The impact of the Ōyama cult on the Kantō region as a popular pilgrimage destination. 
	During the early modern period, some lengthy pilgrimages, such as mass pilgrimages to the Ise Shrines or solitary pilgrimages by impoverished travelers around the island of Shikoku, had a reputation for running counter to the orderly social ideals of the bakufu—they represented in some respects what Victor Turner termed an antistructure to everyday life. **Pilgrimages to Ōyama, however, reinforced rather than undermined social structures.** The pilgrimage shaped the regional identity and inspired numerous woodblock prints, popular travel guides, and other works describing the ritual calendar of Edo residents and travel in the Kantō-Tōkai region. Overland and sea-borne pilgrimage routes developed that linked Ōyama to the Kantō region. **Since pilgrims from Edo took only about one week to complete the pilgrimage, and pilgrims from the northeastern provinces in the Kantō took only about twice as long, the bakufu posed little opposition to the pilgrimage.** Moreover, most pilgrims traveled in confraternities based in rural villages or urban neighborhoods, or organized around professional groups or businesses. Such pilgrims did not abscond from their communities; instead, they were usually dispatched as annual representatives. **Confraternity members pooled their funds to finance the pilgrimage, and therefore the pilgrims were not a burden on communities along the route but fueled the regional economy.** (15-16)
Pilgrimages from Edo shorter, bakufu not opposed. Pilgrims fueled regional economy.

The type of place Oyama was
	As a pilgrimage site, Ōyama was consciously constructed as a remote place far from human habitation; in fact, it was a place marked by its proximity to a major urban center and by great accessibility—pilgrims visiting the mountain, Ōyama’s innkeepers traveling through the region to collect donations and distribute amulets, and Shingon clerics from temples in the region training at Ōyama in order to return to their home temples after the completion of their training period. In its ordinariness, the Ōyama cult occupied a middle ground that was neither at the center of political power nor at the margins of society. **The cultic site that initially survived on patronage by the bakufu came to depend almost exclusively on the donations’ broad social base—villagers, townspeople, and low-ranking officials.** The Ōyama cult was not used by the bakufu to mobilize human resources or to suppress resistance to the regime, but neither was it a movement to subvert the existing social order. The cult flourished precisely because it was based on and upheld the social structures that shaped village and urban life. Therefore, it can serve as a useful case study of mainstream early modern religion and society. (17-18)

##### Conclusion of *Emergence of the Ōyama Oshi*, 
From *Ambros 2008, Emplacing a Pilgrimage The Ōyama Cult and Regional Religion in Early Modern Japan*
	The return to ancient ways envisioned by these Nativist oshi was not simply a return to medieval Ōyama but a mythical, pre-Buddhist site. They did not seek a reinstatement of Ōyama’s shugendō but a pure Shinto tradition. They attempted to reject their status as oshi and re-
*(page 115)*
	define themselves as Shinto shrine priests. Ironically, however, they took for granted the highly popular Ōyama cult, which had resulted from the oshi’s symbiotic relationship with the Shingon clergy during the early modern period.
	It had been their role as oshi that contributed to the spread of the Ōyama cult in the Kantō region in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-turies. Over the course of the seventeenth century, the oshi developed primarily out of yamabushi who had lost much of their authority to the Shingon clergy on the mountain in the first decade of the seventeenth century. Eventually, the tradition of mountain asceticism largely disap- peared from Ōyama in the second half of the seventeenth century and left the former yamabushi to seek new means of income, forcing them to run inns and develop parishes throughout the Kantō region. **These parishes, from which most of Ōyama’s pilgrims came, became the single most important source of income for Ōyama**. The system spread from areas near Ōyama across the entire Kantō region. It was these oshi who sustained the bonds between parishioners and the mountain through making yearly rounds of their parishes and providing accommodations for pilgrims. Despite their conflict-laden genesis, the oshi were not inconstant opposition to Ōyama’s Shingon temples. They developed cus-tomary networks with temples to handle pilgrims and received licenses from the head Shingon temple, Hachidaibō, which helped them to dis-tinguish themselves from their competing innkeepers in neighboring villages. Another reason why the oshi did not voice a united opposition to the temples was that they were in fact a fairly diverse group with different heritages and levels of wealth. Some oshi were in the employ of Hachidaibō and therefore shared the temples’ interests. It was only in the mid-nineteenth century that several wealthy oshi began to seek affiliation with external sources of authority such as the Shirakawa House and to engage in anti-Buddhist rhetoric culled from the Nativist Hirata school. This rhetoric eventually led to friction between the Shingon temples and the oshi, and provided the basis for the disassociation of kami and Buddhas in the early Meiji period.
	**As travel increased in the early modern period, pilgrimages to various sacred sites became popular throughout Japan. Religious specialists like the oshi contributed to the growth and continued popularity of these pilgrimage centers.** Rather than relying on sporadic, haphazard pilgrims,
*(page 116)* 
	**the oshi and their parishes stabilized the sites by forming systems of pilgrimage management**. That is why the most popular early modern pilgrimage centers such as sacred mountains (e.g., Ōyama, Mt. Fuji, and Tateyama) or famous temples and shrines (e.g., Zenkōji and Ise) had oshi or comparable systems. The concrete organizational structures differed from site to site. While Ōyama’s oshi were controlled by the Kogi Shingon clergy, Mt. Fuji’s oshi were organized in self-governing guilds, and at Zenkōji, low-ranking Buddhist clerics (shūto) at subtemples serving as inns were controlled by the Tendai abbot of Zenkōji. Like Ōyama’s oshi, all these religious professionals also owned parishes, collected donations, and distributed amulets. **These proselytizing innkeepers provided the pilgrimage sites with a comparatively stable base of income from their parishioners. They also helped to stem competition and strife by limiting the pool of contenders who could participate in the system and by strictly regulating the interactions with pilgrims and parishioners.** Even though these religious specialists were usually not officially in charge of administering the cultic site, **they represented the key to success for the majority Japan’s early modern pilgrimage cults.**
