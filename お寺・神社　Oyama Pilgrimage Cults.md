What is Oyama?
	Chapters 2 and 3 examine Ōyama’s institutional complexities. A typical premodern cultic site, Ōyama presented an integrated mixture of traditions that were inseparable but not always entirely harmonious. Ōyama comprised Buddhist, Shinto, yamabushi, and oshi institutions of various sectarian affiliations.
	.... the Shingon Buddhist clergy assumed control over Ōyama, maintained its hold over this sacred site, and simultaneously turned it into a major regional Kogi Shingon academy. As a regional Shingon academy that was necessary to train clerics for the growing number of temples established by the temple registration system of early modern Japan, Ōyama was able to become a leader in a regional network of Kogi Shingon temples even though it had few branch temples of its own. As a sacred site, Ōyama was controlled institutionally and ritually by the Shingon clergy, whose twentyplus subtemples on the mountain cooperated in the administration of the site, led by the abbot of Hachidaibō, its main Shingon temple. 
	... The growing popularity of the site and the influx of pilgrims enhanced the Shingon temples’ wealth but also created rifts among them. These factors contributed to the gradual weakening of the Hachidaibō abbots’ control over the site. (14)

	In the first half of the seventeenth century, the oshi, managed large parishes of devotees throughout the Kantō region. By the nineteenth century, about 160 oshi were administering one million parish households across the entire Kantō-Tōkai region with an average of about 6,000 households per oshi. Some of the most powerful oshi had as many as 12,000 parishioner families. These parishes were different from those of Buddhist temples in the temple registration system, which might ideally have had one hundred to a thousand parish households with obligatory ties to the temple through the performance of funerary and memorial rites. Instead of providing funerary rites, oshi distributed amulets and collected yearly donations from their parishioners, housing them in inns at Ōyama when they came on pilgrimage. (15)

Managing pilgrimage cults
	how Ōyama’s ritual specialists, clergy and the oshi, jointly managed the pilgrimage cult, which became centered on the summer festival: The clergy officiated at rituals within the Buddhist precinct, i.e., Ōyama’s principal cultic sites, whereas the oshi lodged pilgrims, acted as intermediaries between pilgrims and clerics, and maintained active relationships with their parishioners through parish rounds to distribute amulets and collect first-fruit donations. By the early nineteenth century, Ōyama had become a highly complex and active site whose influence extended across the entire Kantō region. The Ōyama cult had successfully adapted its economy from one based primarily on state patronage during the medieval period to one based on the donations from a broad social base—its parishioners in villages and urban areas.

	The return to ancient ways envisioned by these Nativist oshi was not simply a return to medieval Ōyama but a mythical, pre-Buddhist site. They did not seek a reinstatement of Ōyama’s shugendō but a pure Shinto tradition. They attempted to reject their status as oshi and re-
*(page 115)*
	define themselves as Shinto shrine priests. Ironically, however, they took for granted the highly popular Ōyama cult, which had resulted from the oshi’s symbiotic relationship with the Shingon clergy during the early modern period.
	It had been their role as oshi that contributed to the spread of the Ōyama cult in the Kantō region in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-turies. Over the course of the seventeenth century, the oshi developed primarily out of yamabushi who had lost much of their authority to the Shingon clergy on the mountain in the first decade of the seventeenth century. Eventually, the tradition of mountain asceticism largely disap- peared from Ōyama in the second half of the seventeenth century and left the former yamabushi to seek new means of income, forcing them to run inns and develop parishes throughout the Kantō region. **These parishes, from which most of Ōyama’s pilgrims came, became the single most important source of income for Ōyama**. The system spread from areas near Ōyama across the entire Kantō region. It was these oshi who sustained the bonds between parishioners and the mountain through making yearly rounds of their parishes and providing accommodations for pilgrims. Despite their conflict-laden genesis, the oshi were not inconstant opposition to Ōyama’s Shingon temples. They developed cus-tomary networks with temples to handle pilgrims and received licenses from the head Shingon temple, Hachidaibō, which helped them to dis-tinguish themselves from their competing innkeepers in neighboring villages. Another reason why the oshi did not voice a united opposition to the temples was that they were in fact a fairly diverse group with different heritages and levels of wealth. Some oshi were in the employ of Hachidaibō and therefore shared the temples’ interests. It was only in the mid-nineteenth century that several wealthy oshi began to seek affiliation with external sources of authority such as the Shirakawa House and to engage in anti-Buddhist rhetoric culled from the Nativist Hirata school. This rhetoric eventually led to friction between the Shingon temples and the oshi, and provided the basis for the disassociation of kami and Buddhas in the early Meiji period.
	**As travel increased in the early modern period, pilgrimages to various sacred sites became popular throughout Japan. Religious specialists like the oshi contributed to the growth and continued popularity of these pilgrimage centers.** Rather than relying on sporadic, haphazard pilgrims,
*(page 116)* 
	**the oshi and their parishes stabilized the sites by forming systems of pilgrimage management**. That is why the most popular early modern pilgrimage centers such as sacred mountains (e.g., Ōyama, Mt. Fuji, and Tateyama) or famous temples and shrines (e.g., Zenkōji and Ise) had oshi or comparable systems. The concrete organizational structures differed from site to site. While Ōyama’s oshi were controlled by the Kogi Shingon clergy, Mt. Fuji’s oshi were organized in self-governing guilds, and at Zenkōji, low-ranking Buddhist clerics (shūto) at subtemples serving as inns were controlled by the Tendai abbot of Zenkōji. Like Ōyama’s oshi, all these religious professionals also owned parishes, collected donations, and distributed amulets. **These proselytizing innkeepers provided the pilgrimage sites with a comparatively stable base of income from their parishioners. They also helped to stem competition and strife by limiting the pool of contenders who could participate in the system and by strictly regulating the interactions with pilgrims and parishioners.** Even though these religious specialists were usually not officially in charge of administering the cultic site, **they represented the key to success for the majority Japan’s early modern pilgrimage cults.**
