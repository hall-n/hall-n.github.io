#### Governance styles of early Tokugawa 


Except for those few sengoku-daimyé on the fringes of the islands who managed to keep their territories under the Tokugawa, the rest of the entire top bracket of the military aristocracy in Japan now traced its origins to that narrow sector of central Japan which had been the home of the Oda and Tokugawa houses. 344
So long as an active balance between fudai and tozama daimyo immobilized opposition to the shogun, the Tokugawa ready forces of gokenin and hatamoto was in fact the dominant power in all Japan.
..
During the period of Tokugawa hegemony Japan was governed under the broad unifying capacity of the shogun, but actual administration was partially decentralized under the regional authorities of the various daimyo. This was a system which had no ready counterpart to the national structures of other societies, and hence any attempt to characterize it by such terms as late feudalism, centralized feudalism, or military absolutism is apt to be misleading. The Tokugawa regime must be understood in its own terms as a political organism in which the daimyo set the basic pattern of local 345
government, accepting a unity under the shogun which precluded further warfare but which left them a considerable degree of autonomy. 346
(Tokugawa connecting himself to Minamoto (Genji) and *ason* close to the imperial family) These many aspects of the aristocratic social tradition were kept alive by the Tokugawa, reinforced and formalized after 1600 as new peerages were drawn up and the daimyo houses fitted into the hierarchy of lineages. 348


Such were the many traditional sources of legitimacy plumbed
by the Tokugawa shoguns. Yet despite all that has been said, the legal **precariousness of the Tokugawa shogunate** is obvious, and was obvious to the men of the Tokugawa period as well. Sovereignty continued to rest in the emperor, and the chief justification of the shogunate was that it was best qualified to rule in the name of the emperor. That this laid the shogunate open to attacks of (354) usurpation and that it became a fatal weakness when once its power had failed is well known. Throughout the Tokugawa period it was the existence of real power together with the symbols which combined to support the shogun in his position as hegemon. This in turn rested largely on the effective power base upon which the shogunate was built. In a rough way this power base was equatable to the balance
of land holdings touched upon in the previous part of this chapter.(353)

Bakufu administrative dominance of major commercial centers could mean that the shogun had access to the largest supplies of loan capital, and through the great cities of Edo and Osaka the shogunate could pretty well control monetary and commercial policy in Japan. 358


Any assessment of the effective balance of military power represented by the strategic disposition of shogunal and daimyo territories must be based on an analysis of the manpower and economic resources which these territories made available to the competing groups within the political system.  357
Tokugawa's authority 
If Tokugawa manpower was rather thinly and irregularly distributed across the Japanese islands, the shogun’s lands were outstanding in terms of their economic potential. It is generally assumed that the shogun attempted to reserve for himself land which was of highest quality and productiveness. 358

(Tokugawa's control of mines, can regulate currency, monopoly of foreign imports, monopoly of internal commodities like marine products and vegetable oils)
So long as the economic and technological level of the country re- (358)
mained relatively unchanged, the Tokugawa could thus claim certain economic advantages which made possible their domination of national economic policy and the nationwide organs of exchange and transportation. 
BaAsED upon these and many other sources of real power the Tokugawa shogunate was able to organize a system of controls which institutionalized the supremacy of the shogun in government and over the major sectors of national life. The(359)


Daimyo's precariousness
While it was expected that daimyo held their territories as hereditary grants, in actuality their tenure was precarious and at the pleasure of each shogun. Confiscation or transfer from one locality to another was quite frequent (362)
Changes of domain, known as kaieki, were ordered by the shogun under a number of circumstances but primarily for lack of heir, mismanagement, infringement of the basic regulations of the shogunate, or, of course, as a sign of favor.  (362)

**Inspection of daimyo**
Inspection of the daimyo domains, both openly and through
an intelligence system, was common. In 1633 Iemitsu began the practice of dispatching inspectors (junkenshi) to the domains of the daimyo to check on local conditions. They asked questions concerning the productivity of the domains, their financial and military resources, population, methods of administration, the standard of living of the people, and the like. (364)

**Decentralized**
In the baku-han system, the shogun governed directly only his own tenry0. The rest of the country remained under the decentralized rule of the daimyo. Moreover (367)
The preponderance of shogunal power was so great, the shogunal lands were so widespread, so many of the important towns and cities were under direct shogunal control, and so many of the daimyo (particularly the fudai) were so completely integrated into the bakufu machinery, that the shogunate did in most senses constitute a central authority. The bakufu bureaucracy provided for much more than simply the administration of the tenryd; in fact, it bore responsibility for (368) 

The tendency to adopt uniform policies and procedures increased tremendously as the daimyo established their residences in Edo and themselves became part of an integrated, elite society. 374

Used confucian thought to 
Tokugawa shoguns and their daimyo subordinates made extensive use of Confucian principles of social theory and value in order to rationalize the social system of their day and add the sanctity of doctrine to the status-based legislation in which they indulged. (370)

**Removed directly from farms meant relationship shift**
By the end of the seventeenth century nearly all daimyo had successfully withdrawn their retainers from the land and had clipped their ability to touch the peasants directly. The private fief had been absorbed into the daimyo’s uniform field administration. As a consequence the peasantry and other classes as well came to acquire a more uniform public identity under the laws of the bakufu and daimyo. Above the villagers the daimyo and their retainers stood, not as manorial lords or patriarchal superiors, but as rulers and officials. (392)

It is this subtle but fundamental change in the whole structure of society and the exercise of authority in Japan which marked the transition from the age of the sengoku-daimyo to that of the Tokugawa baku-han system.
Throughout Japanese society the authority relationships between lord and vassal, between enfeoffed proprietor and cultivator, between patriarchal family head and attached household, these essentially vertical systems were being replaced by more generalized, horizontally defined, functional group relationships. (392)
But the spread of this new functional approach to social organization created yet another ened, that the daimyo devise a more rational basis of authority, a new ideological foundation for his rule and the type of society it embraced. It was this requirement which put a premium upon the daimyo’s ability to civilize himself and to assume the guise of the enlightened despot. And it was in this context that the Tokugawa reliance on Confucian ethical values and concepts of social structure played such important roles. (393)
**The successful daimyo after 1600 was one who learned to master the ethical-rational system of beliefs which supported his right to rule as a benevolent autocrat committed to the welfare of his subjects** (393)
#### Bizen's Mitumasa's quality of social responsibility
In Bizen Mitsumasa quickly proved himself one of the great daimyo of his age, gaining a reputation as one of the “three outstanding administrators” of the Tokugawa period. The events of Mitsumasa’s rule are therefore doubly important, since it was under him that the institutions of the Tokugawa Great Peace were firmly established (402)
in Bizen and since Mitsumasa provides us with one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age. (403)

The outstanding quality which Mitsumasa brought to Bizen was a certain style of benevolent authoritarianism based on Confucian principles of governance. Mitsumasa_ built upon the foundations of faitacy organization and civil administration which had been laid by his predecessors, filling out the body of codified injunctions and bureaucratic precedents. But he went further and added to his rule the indispensable ingredient of moral rationale. Mitsumasa was not alone in this. The Tokugawa bakufu had led the way in drawing upon the concepts of Confucianism and seeking ideological justification for its regime in the claims of benevolent government. Mitsumasa’s fame rests on the fact that he pioneered in adapting these ideas to the field of daimyo rule and that he so persistently sought to regulate his own conduct by them. (403)

Failure of the year’s crop brought famine conditions in its wake, and the suffering of the peasantry during the winter of 1654 was extreme. Mitsumasa took these events as a direct reflection on his rule, and reacted vigorously both by providing relief for the sufferers and by admonishing his housemen for lax behavior. He believed that in too many instances his enfeoffed retainers had sacrificed the welfare of the peasantry in order to squeeze taxes from their fiefs. ..
After the flood of 1654, Mitsumasa became much more the firm authoritarian ruler of his domain, preaching frequently to his assembled housemen about the need for discipline, loyalty, and selfless service to the people of the domain. (406)

#### Wanted education for commoners
Meanwhile he proceeded with a vigorous educational policy. In 1660 a new domain college (karigakkan) based on Confucian principles was begun and in 1668 a system of elementary writing schools (tenaraijo) for commoners was ordered into effect. The latter proved too costly and had to be abandoned. Education for the upper levels only of the common people was eventually taken care of after 1670 with the establishment of Shizutani School (Shizutani gakko) to which samurai also went.  (408)

#### Bizen was common type of ruling
The administration of Bizen was typical of the kind which was provided by the larger daimyo of the Tokugawa period. (410)
