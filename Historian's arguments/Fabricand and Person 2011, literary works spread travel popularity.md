##### Literary meisho influenced desire to travel
Literary allusion in the form of meisho (famous place) added another important dimension to Chikusai monogatari, to later fictional guidebooks, and, eventually, to the woodblock prints and paintings of the Tōkaidō journey. Traditionally, the word meisho carried with it an understanding that a place was famous for both its beauty and its association with classical poetry and literature. The mere mention of such a place was a literary allusion that imparted multiple layers of meaning to the contemporary Japanese audience. The fact that many of these famous places were to be found along the Tōkaidō Road added to its distinction—even if some had long since disappeared.

##### example of meisho book popularizing travel
By 1700, a different kind of guidebook—the meisho zue (illustrations of famous places)—began to appear. Among the most famous of these was the Tōkaidō meisho zue (Illustrations of the Famous Sites on the Tōkaidō), written by Akisato Ritō (1776–1830) and published in six volumes in 1797. Because the text of Tōkaidō meisho zue is not character-driven, the book’s focus differs from that of Chikusai monogatari and Tōkaidō meishoki. As can be seen in the illustration from the set recently acquired by Marquand Library (fig. 1), Tōkaidō meisho zue replaced the convention of depicting character exploits at post stations and the interesting sites along the way with panoramic landscapes and scenes of everyday life. The accompanying text celebrated these scenes with historical, mythological, and commercial information, along with quotations from diaries and literature. Tōkaidō meisho zue was produced in collaboration with the painter Takehara Shunchōsai and includes illustrations by twenty-five other artists. More than 30 percent of the nearly one thousand pages are occupied by illustrations.21 The meisho zue genre of guidebook gave the Japanese public a visual knowledge of the topography of the Tōkaidō and a look at everyday activities in different parts of the country in their geographic context.22 The text enhanced the visual experience by offering information that was both factual and legendary.
