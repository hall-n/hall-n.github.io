*Goree 2020, The Culture of Travel in Edo*
Useful historical overviews published from the 1980s by <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Konno and Kanzaki explore the cultural consequences of travel as an institution shaped by the state</mark>. Their tendency to approach the topic <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">through the lens of political administration</mark> is more pronounced in an earlier generation of scholars, including <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Kodama, Maruyama, and Igarashi, who dwell on how the shogunate regulated travel through transportation infrastructure</mark>, such as road systems, barrier checkpoints, and post-stations. In the 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of scholars began to approach institutional history as a way to link travel to political developments. In studies about alternate attendance and recreational travel, Constantine <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Vaporis challenges the view that the authorities fully controlled travel</mark>, stimulating new directions in research that account for travel from the perspective of travelers. Representing a different strain of institutional history, Ronald Toby and Gregory Smits analyze the movements of foreigners in and around Japan to demonstrate the complexity of foreign relations in the region and critique the still-persistent notion that Japan was completely closed off from the rest of the world during the period. 18-19

Much of the scholarship linked to travel and culture in the period concerns pilgrimage and pilgrimage sites. There remains little debate about whether the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">sacred and profane blended in the act of pilgrimage, as seen in the work of Nelson Graburn and Susanne Formanek</mark>, but there are diverging interpretations about how and why this occurred. Under the influence of modernization theory, Nishiyama Matsunosuke theorizes a process of evolution by which the religious act became increasingly secular, culminating in full-blown recreational travel with devotional elements by the end of the period. Challenging this teleological view, Higuchi Kiyoyuki, Shinno Toshikazu, and Nam-lin Hur argue for the complementarity of religious devotion and recreational pleasure during the entire period. 91 Sarah Thal, Max Moerman, and Barbara Ambros enter into the debate with in-depth studies of specific temples and shrines, analyzing them as layered landscapes with cultural, devotional, socioeconomic, and political dimensions. Laura Nenzi’s contribution is to account for identity, gender, and the commodification of culture in the lived experience of travelers. 19
