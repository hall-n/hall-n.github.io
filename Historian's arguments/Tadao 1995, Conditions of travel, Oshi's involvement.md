##### Tourism linked to mairi
The background of the popularization of tourism in Japan's Edo period lies in the significant role played by the practice of visiting and worshipping at temples and shrines. It was because this system of visiting temples and shrines for worship was recognized that, even during the shogunate's rule over feudal domains, commoners were permitted to travel outside their native villages. This made possible the distinction in practice between the official purpose (tatemae) of travel to worship at shrines and temples and the real motive (honne) of taking a pleasure trip.

##### Religious groups were travel agencies
They were generally run by those connected to religious establishments, such as low level priests called onshi or oshi, who posted their subordinates and deputies around the country to act as tour guides. These priests contributed greatly to ï½¥the institutionalization of package tours. 
... These examples show that in Japan religious oMcials had a role in institutionalizing the travel industry from before the Edo period.  (6)
