*Traganou 2004, The Tokaido Road- Travelling and Representation in Edo and Meiji Japan*
(Review by #Wigen)
presents pilgrimage as an affront to the feudal order and at threat to the authority of the bakufu

people are as much products of discourse as producers of it; the fleeting freedoms of the road are largely illusory; and the regulatory apparatus is never far from view.
when Traganou wants to show that mobility was a "departure from the feudal condition" (p. 6), she makes her case by contrasting government drawings of the Tõkaidõ with their commercial counterparts. Official maps and views depict the Tokugawa turnpike as a stark landscape of control, devoid of human figures and dominated by government barriers and checkpoints. In popular prints, by contrast, the same corridor is crowded with commoners; jostling shopkeepers and pleasure-seeking consumers symbolically overrun the regulatory apparatus of the shogun.

## Abstracts
_The Tôkaidô Road_ offers a comparative study of the Tôkaidô road's representations during the Edo (1600-1868) and Meiji (1868-1912) eras. Throughout the Edo era, the Tôkaidô highway was the most important route of Japan and transportation was confined to foot travel. In 1889, the Tôkaidô Railway was established, at first paralleling and eventually almost eliminating the use of the highway. During both periods, the Tôkaidô was a popular topic of representation and was depicted in a variety of visual and literary media. After the installation of the railway in the Meiji era, the Tôkaidô was presented as a landscape of progress, modernity and westernisation. Such representations were fundamental in shaping the Tôkaidô and the realm of travelling in the collective consciousness of the Japanese people.

#### Bakufu against peasants and women traveling
Tokugawa discouraged non-official traveling, especially that of women and farmers. The movement of the first was prohibited mainly for the fear that the wives of the daimyō could escape Edo and go back to their province (han). With regard to farmers, Tokugawa ideology favored agriculture as the material and moral backbone of their society, and farmers traveling meant reduction of agricultural production. Thus farmers had to remain at the place of their registration and they required official permission to travel (Vaporis 1994:136–59).
. Restrictions on farmers’ mobility had been imposed since the early Edo period, through the Proclamation of Seven Articles of 1603, which allowed farmers to leave their village only if they had a legitimate grievance against the overlord and if they followed procedures established by the authorities (Satō 1990:40–1).

#### Pilgrimage became threat to bakufu
Muromachi authorities saw pilgrimage as a means to collect money through the tolls and thus did not object to it. In the Edo period, it was commonly said that everyone should go on pilgrimage at least once in his lifetime, and pilgrimage became uncontrolled and even a threat to the authority of the bakufu. While farmers were allowed to go on pilgrimage, and did so especially during the slack seasons of the agricultural calendar, warriors, daimyō and samurai were not encouraged to participate. 

#### okage-mairi upset local economies
Okage-mairi upset local economies, causing inflation of the prices of rice, straw, lodgings and other necessities, and had political ramifications being related to farmers’ rebellions, such as ikki. For this reason, the upper classes viewed popular religious movements with alarm and distaste. 72

#### Argument that pilgrimage is pretext, ie desire for leisure travel was first
The use of the pilgrimage as a pretext for travel in order to obtain secular pleasures is clear in the travel literature of the Edo period.
