*Ishimori 2009, Popularization and commercialization of tourism in early modern Japan*
#Ishimori_2009 
##### Value of tourism studies
Thus todrism can be one of the most appropriate themes for the comparative studies of civilizations to interprete various aspects of historical processes in the wider perspective．(193)

##### Pilgrimage cost effort and money
Considering that the people who traveled outside their home country at that time must had to have a permit and a certificate, which functioned much like a present day passport, and they spent a large amount of money, such travels in the Edo period can be regarded as the overseas travel in the present day. 

##### Tourism started in  Genroku era (1688-1704)
Other historical sources also suggests that the popularization of tourism started in the Genroku era (1688-1704), and many people travelled for pleasure while nominally visiting shrines and temples for worship or visiting hot springs for healing illnesses. (181)

##### Tourism existed in Muromachi, but couldn't flourish because dangers and poor road
Travels for pleasure and worship were getting popular among the common people in the Kinki district, but the people living outside Kinki still could not afford to travel widely because of the unfavourable conditions for long distance travels. For instance, road networks were not developed and also accomModation facilities were not easily available, and travellers were often attacked by bandits and pirates. Moreover, civil wars in the late Muromachi period worsened the conditions for traveling, so that few people tried to travel for pleasure. (182)

##### Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1602) 
a result of abolition of the checkpoints al1 over the country, people were no longer levied heavy clearance fees, and long distance travels became easier and safer.

##### Early edo
In the early Edo period (early･ seventeenth century), conditions for the long distance travel were further improved. The road networks were highly developed and, accommodation facilities along roads provided meals, so that travellers no longer had to bring their own food. In addition, economic development leveled off regional differences and raised the economic standard of the common people, resulting in a nationwide traveling boom. (182)

##### Limited movement for government safety reasons
However, there still existed very strict restrictions on travel, because freedom of movement was not allowed for the people under the feudal system. All the travellers inebitably necessitated to ･pQssess "brai kitte" (traMc stamp) and "sekisho tegata" (checkpoint pass) while travelling. People was not permitted to leave their place of residence and to travel without such passport-like cenificates. The traMc stamp was a kind of identification card issued under the joint signature of the monk of the temple to which the one belonged and a landowner or a village chief. The checkpoint pass was issued by the fedual lord or the governmental magistrates, and was necessary for passing through the checkpoints. Women leaving Edo (Tokyo) were especially required to carry a checkpoint pass with detailed specifications. As the proverb, "Incoming guns and outgoing women" suggests, the Tokugawa government severely prevented the womenfolk of lords from leaving. (182)
the capital for their home provinces. They were a kind of hostage for the central government and were obliged to reside in Edo in order to prevent uprising against the government. The Tokugawa government also was very keen to prevent the importation of weapons into the capital since they were liable to be used for rebellions. (183)

##### Officials couldn't refuse medical and worshiping permit applications
All kinds of travel required permission in the form of traffic stamps and checkpoipt passes, and if the purpose of a travel was simply for pleasure or sightseeing, it was certainly not permitted. However, there are at least two exceptional cases for the common people to be allowed to travel a long distance. They were travel to shrines and temples for worship, and to hot springs for healing illnesses. The applications for long distance travel were submitted nominally under these headings, even though the actual purpose were just for pleasure and sightseeing. Visiting shrines and temples for religious worship, and visiting hot springs for medical treatment were so rea'sonable and persuasive that no governMent oMcials could refuse these applications, notwithstanding that the actual purpose were just for pleasure and sightseeing. (183)

##### Inns serving food helped tourism grow
In the middle of the Edo period inns began to serve meals for the first time. It was a radical change for the traveler since they no longer needed to bring any food. The introduction of meal service at inns contributed the development of travel for pleasure. The introduction of serving meals at inns inevitablly entailed the development of prostitution which was one of the important aspects of tourism. Every "shukuba" (station) had some brothels, and many male travelers visited there for female attraction. 

##### Government abolished brothels at inns to control morals, but doesn't mention tourism
In the second year of Manji era (1659), the government decided to abolish the brothels at "shukuba" in order to control of people's morals. Since (184)
that time, waitresses at inns played a very important role not only in serving meals but also in serving as night mates for male customers [MiyAMoTo 1965]. The availability of such services at inns was most welcomed by many male travelers in non-ordinary playful setting. Iri the Genroku era the numbers of these waitresses greatly increased in accordance with the booming of tourism. The prevalence of prostitution at "shukuba" (station) by waitresses naturally brought controls by the police in .the third year of Kyoho (1718). 'The government proclaimed that the number of the waitresses should be limited to 2 persons per inn. (185)

##### Towns developed around tourist spots
The development of visitors' lodgings resulted in towns forming around temples and shrines. Such towns called "monzenmachi" developed around the big shrines and temples. (185)

##### Meiseki junrei became popular because of it's tourism nature
Thirdly, "meiseki junrei", which' was a pilgrimage to visit "meiseki," (famous religious places), was known as the pilgrimage to the seven big temples in Nara or to the twenty-one temples of the Nichiren sect. Among these three, the first and second ones were more purely religion-oriented while the third is more tourism-oriented. In the middle of the Edo period the pilgrimage of the third kind became popular because of its tourism oriented nature. (186)

##### Tourism like service *shida seido*
Another important institution which contributed to the development of tourism was "shidon seido", which was the priest-parishioner institution, especially in the Ise and Kumano Shrines. Under this institutional system, the parishioners of a district contracted permanently with a specific priest who was responsible to arrange a group tour to visit the shrine. The priest send the tour guide or representative, who was called "sendotsu" or "doikan", to lead a group of parishioners to visit the shrine. After arriving at the destination this priest offered comfortable accomodation faci!ities and arranged for worship at the shrine, and also took care to guide his parishioners to the theatres, souvenir shops, restaurants, and even brothels. The prevalence of the visits to the Ise Shrine in the Edo period became feasible through such an institutional device. (186)

##### This system was economically attractive
Historically, the Kumano priests were more active in the medieval age, but in the Edo period they were replaced by the Ise priests who gained strong commercial power and prosperity through their success in attracting such huge numbers of people to the Ise Shrine. Other big temples at Mt. Fuji, Mt. Koya, Mt. Tateyama, Dewa Sanzan, Mt. Hakusan and Zenkoji Temple adopted this priest-parishioner institution, which was invented in･itially by the priests of the Kumano and Ise Shrines. Such priests and guides were the forerunners of travel agents in Japan, and they greatly contributed to the development and the structure of tourism in early modern Japan. (186)

##### Economic incentives behind *ko* group system
In accordance with the development of activities by the priests to attract visitors to the shrines and temples, mutual cooperative association called "kO" were established in the villages [SAKuRAi 1962]. This association had two pri.ncipal aims. It functioned as a religious association to promote worship at specific shrines and terpples, and also as an economic association to raise fund for visiting the specific shrine or temple for worship. (186)

##### Ise and Kumano shrines more for pleasure, Shikoku for religion
Most of these "ko" associations, except for the ones for the Ise and Kumano Shrines, were established in the early modern age in accordance with the development of tourism. Such religious and economic institutions as "kb" associations contributed to the development of tourism in Japan.  On the contrary, it should be noted that there were no such associations for pilgrimages to Saigoku, Shikoku and Chichibu. This fact indicates that a pilgrimage was a purely religious act performed with as little expense as possible, whereas other travels to visit famous shrines and temples were mostly for pleasure, and required great expenditures which the common people could not afford, so that the people tried to share the expense by organizing such mutual aid associations. (187)

##### Nukemairi, everyone should visit Ise at least once
Those secret visits had some special characteristics. Firstly, secret visits were limited to the Ise Shrine, because there was a popular belief during the Edo period that everyone should visit the Ise Shrine at least once in their life. Those who traveled without oMcal permission were normally punished severely, but those who went for secret visits to the Ise Shrine were not punished on their return. Moreover, on their way to and from the Ise Shrine they were welcomed by the rich people serving meals and alms, so that anyone could make a secret visit without having money. It was believed that giving alms to the poor "secret visitors" would be one of the best means to cultivate or accuniulate virtue for wealthy people. (187)
The secret visits in the second year of Houei era (1705), for instance, numbered 3,620,OOO, and then there were 2,070,OOO in the 8th year of Meiwa era (1771), and 4,270,OOO in the 13th year of Bunsei era (1830) (SHiNJo 1971: 197-1981. Japan's population at that time is estimated to have been around thirty million, so that the above figures indicate that more than 10 percent of the population made secret visits to the Ise Shrine. (188)

##### Nukemairi into okagemairi
Most of the visits were made during the few months that farmers were free from their agricultural tasks. Such visits to the Ise Shrine were called "okage mairi", which literally means "thanks visits", because of the favour given by the god and also by those people who gave various alms on the way. (188)

##### Omiage travel services 
Travelers also were freed from carrying heavy loads with the development of a cargo transportation system. Travelers from the, eastern provinces usually made a round trip, visiting the Ise Shrine, the Hase Temple, Asuka, Yoshino, Mt. Koya, Osaka and Kyoto. When they left Ise they consigned al1 the unnecessary items and souvenirs to a courier service, and then those parcels would be picked up at their reserved inn in Kyoto on their way back to their home villages. Thus service industries related tO travel and tourism were highly developed in the Edo period. (188)


##### Tourism due to developed but not over developed road system, walking
Highly developed road networks during the Edo period and comfortable accomodation facilities were essential elements in the development of tourism. Paradoxically, however, the underdevelopment of the means of transportation stimulated the popularization of traveling. Most travelers had to walk, except for those riding a "kago" (palanquin) or a horse. (192)

##### Traveling spread knowledge
Moreover, information brought by the travelers was highly evaluated in the Edo period. Mass media was not developed at･the time, so that face to face information fulfi11ed most important role. Those who went traveling to the cities and came back to the village were called "monoshiri", literally meaning a "knowing person". The village people eagerly anticipated the acquisition of knowledge from cities and tried to follow the changes in life styles because they regarded the cities as the centers and sources of standards in fashions and ljfe styles. A traveler who visited the cities, as a "knowing person", told what he saw and experienced there when he got back home. Such anxiety and eagerness for knowledge brought from cities encouraged the village people to travel widely. Since travel was always related to the acquisition and transmission of information, the popularization of tourism contributed to the diffusion back to the hinterlands of information about what was happening in the capital and other important cities'like Kyoto and Osaka. 

##### Traveling contributed to expansion of markets which favoured economic prosperity

^653ba1

Traveling also contributed to the diffusion of agricultural techniques and special local products, and to the expansion of markets which favoured economic prosperity. Owing to the development and popularization of tourism Japan could cope with the radical changes at the end of the Tokugawa regime and after the MeiJi Restoration. (192)



## Ishimori 1995 Shogunate tighten control over religion, leads to more public visiting religions places and donate. This made Kaicho popularized around the country
#Ishimori_1995

"kaich6 which is the display of an image at the temple which owns it, and the other is the degaich6 which involves transporting the image to another place for viewing" (Ishimori 1995, 15)
##### Degaicho attracted vendors and shows
"For the pilgrims, the primary benefit of the kaicho" was to obtain divine protection by establishing ties with Buddha. However, for the monks at the temples, the primary benefit was the extra revenue, while the Shogunate benefited from the demonstration of its power through the OMce of Temple and Shrine Administration." (Ishimori 1995, 16)
"although the kaich6 was originally conceived as a purely religious event based on simple faith, in reality, it contained many elements of tourism. A system was created by utilizing religious facilities such as the temple grounds and holy images and deploying various aspects of the religious institutions so that the organizers could earn extra revenue, and the visitors could not only worship the religious image, but also enjoy the plays, attractions, gambling, and shopping for souvenirs [GRABuRN 1983]." (Ishimori 1995, 16)
"As times change, so does the experience of 7Vtzminose. Thus, there are people who perceive it while participating in religious services in a cathedral, temple, or shrine, while others have a similar experience while surrounded by the crowds at Disneyland or when slipping into a mineral bath at a hot spring resort. **Although some things change, however, the homologous relationship between religion and tourism remains constant."** (Ishimori 1995, 23) ^a99347
