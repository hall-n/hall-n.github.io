*Vaporis 1994, Breaking Barriers, Travel and the State in Early Modern Japan*
#Vaporis_1994 


there was an intimate relationship between travel and pilgrimage. They were to a large extent synonymous-a fact that is readily apparent from a quick perusal of travel permits and diaries. Authorities were much more tolerant of pilgrimage than other types of travel because of its sacred nature as a religious act; and, therefore, travel often fell under that rubric. (4)
The findings of this study will reveal a great disjunction between government regulations on travel and the social reality at which they were aimed. Countless persons from all social ranks defied governmental authority by traveling without official permission despite the volumes of legislation intended to regulate or restrict movement. Such legislation appears to have been ·merely a reaction to the social reality that existed and thus, ip. a sense, was little more than sumptuary legislation. The social, economic, and political implications of this interpretation necessarily recast our view of Tokugawa society.
This study, furthermore, will show that government policy regarding travel was, on the whole, positive rather than repressive; the application of regulations was far more flexible than suggested by statute. This growing flexibility in a system that originally had been more rigid allowed for-and in fact promoted-the increasing mobility that characterized Tokugawa Japan from the eighteenth century on.
As we look at Tokugawa society through the prism of travel and communications, we will have to discard certain assumptions and viewpoints. For example, legalistic or authoritarian views of Tokugawa Japan assume that government by nature seeks to be intrusive, to regulate closely all aspects of society. With regard to the regulation of physical mobility, it has been asserted that, in the Tokugawa era, "free movement was severely restricted."12
The historical record will reveal that the situation was far more complicated than this. While the legal structure did not change dramatically during the early modern period, the application and interpretation of the law most certainly did; the government reacted to and tried to keep pace with the changing economic and social landscape.(5)
#### The negative economic effects of travel gave reasons for bakufu and daimyo to want to discourage travel

^4c2305

the primary intent behind the relay system was economic: hence the bakufu's policy of discouraging sea transport, which would have allowed travelers to skip post stations and would reduce the amount of revenue they could raise through provision of transport services. (26)
The application of Tokugawa law was at times unpredictable and random, but it could also be flexible, for it was a traditional principle in Japanese law that reason should prevail over custom and precedent (179)
Sekisho were concerned primarily with the movement of people-particularly women-out of Edo, contributing perhaps to the laxity with which other offenders were treated. Status was also a factor; while there are only two cases of samurai committing a sekisho-related offense, in both instances the samurai were made to suffer the death penalty. These cases, compared with those of commoners, emphasize the great distance that government maintained between status groups.  (181)
**regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control**…There were limits to what the state could do to prohibit pilgrimage, which was widely accepted in society as a sacred act, and the evidence shows that the control measures instituted were generally ineffective. (198)

#### Most common restrictions on any long-distance travel had to do with timing 

^99563b

Perhaps the most common restrictions on any long-distance travel had to do with timing. Since travel during the agricultural season would take a peasant away from the land, in theory decreasing the agricultural output of a village, long-distance travel was generally restricted to the agricultural off-season, after taxes had been collected. (198)
This illegal traffic was hurting business at Sekigawa and Nojiri, the post stations on either side of the sekisho that travelers bypassed. As a result, some officials from Nojiri apparently disabled or partially dismantled a bridge on the side road to stop the traffic, indicating that there were important economic reasons for travel restrictions. (190)

#### Authorities lax with punishment
**Commoners evaded sekisho, it seems, without great concern about possible punishment, implying that the authorities gave tacit approval of the short-cuts or that punishment was rarely exacted**  (191)
..
Travel permits obtained indiscriminately while on one's journey defeated the primary purpose for which they were intended: that is, to provide a guarantee for the traveler's identity and behavior. Nevertheless, goverx:tment authorities did not come out strongly against the practice…It is clear that in many parts of the country, particularly in the north, travelers without permits could obtain passage through domain barriers, and at least some bakufu sekisho, for a fee. In some cases the money went towards the purchase of a permit, while in others the fee charged was in effect a toll. In this respect, Tokugawa barriers resembled those of the Middle Ages.69 In either case, however, it amounted to the same thingthe undermining of a control system  (196)
...
These economic requirements for travel were general conditions established by private domains and bakufu authorities. But, if we look closely at the requirements, they are not as strict as they appear, for they did not interfere with the flow of life. Not many responsible households would leave on an expensive journey with work to be done in the fields or with taxes unpaid. Consequently, these regulations seem to have been aimed more at commoners who would be more inclined to drop everything at a moment's notice to go on pilgrimage-servant personnel, temporary workers, and tenants. (199)
..
Officials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners….The physical and legal barriers erected by the state were insufficient to thwart commoners' desire to travel; although the government continued to keep these barriers in place, they gave their tacit and sometimes explicit approval to travelers who circumvented them (216)



#### Money leaving domain was one reason for being against pilgrimage

^cad2d2

travelers commonly covered 40 kilometers a day (200)
Domains in western Japan generally permitted relatively long periods of time for pilgrimage, which, judging by actual travel times, allowed extra time for sightseeing… In contrast, a number of eastern domains were strict with time limits, but gradually relaxed them
..
It is difficult to know to what we should attribute the fact that western domains were more generous than eastern ones. It could indicate a more lenient attitude in regulating the peasantry in Western Japan, or reflect the superior economic position of the populace in western domains. Time limits for eastern domains might have been gradually raised in an attempt to limit the length of trips of persons no longer obeying regulations. Or they could, instead, be seen as a reaction to better economic conditions. (200)
..
Nevertheless, the fact that punishment for abrogating time limits was rare lends support to the proposition that, with the generally improving economic conditions, Tokugawa commoners traveled more often and on longer journeys; and regulations tried to keep pace with that trend. (200-201)
..
To this end, copies of the Shikoku and Saikoku (Thirty!fhree Kannon Temple) circuits, as well as other popular pilgrimage routes and sites, W!'!re made within individual domains. The Aizu daimyo, for example, built an Ise Shrine, a Kumano Shrine, and a Thirty!fhree-Kannon Temple circuit right at home. A copy of the Saikoku or Western circuit was even created in the bakufu-controlled city of Osaka during the Genroku era. Together with establishing these would-be diversions, daimyo also tried to convince the people that worshipping outside the domain would mean that the local kami, or deities, were being neglected. (202)
..
Kaga restricted travel to Hongan-ji in Kyoto to once in a lifetime. **The reason authorities cited was the desire to stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver.** (202)
..
**Most prohibitions occurred from the mid-Tokugawa on, particularly after the turn of the nineteenth century, when fiscal problems worsened for many domains….Reasons given for bans in Yonezawa likewise were related to poor crops, drought, and inflation**. (203)
Many people ran out of funds while traveling, especially to Ise, but resorted to less extreme measures than Saisaburo, taking out loans in order to return home. **Travel could thus set back some people even after they returned home-and a peasant who ruined himself financially hurt his domain's economy.** (209)

#### Social issues surrounding acceptance of pilgrimage
Daimyo were particularly leery of preventing people from worshipping at Ise; for in the words of Kaiho Seiryo, the late·1'okugawa political economist, such actions would cause the government to "lose the hearts of the people." (204)
..
The social acceptance of pilgrimage as a religious act as well as a rite of passage to adulthood could obviate the need for a permit, as the evidence on the Ise okagemairi demonstrates; and it could also protect many pilgrims from reprisals from those whose authority they had flouted by leaving without permission. (205)
..
.The eventual emergence of passports points to the growing popularity of travel, and reflects an easing of restrictions on commoner travel as well as the increasing ability of commoners to circumvent barriers erected to check their physical mobility
Example:
	Like many urban dwellers across the country, Kita and Yaji obtained their passports to travel on pilgrimage from their family temple, where their identities were on record. Being tenants, they also could have obtained them from their landlord; but since they owed him money, it is doubtful that he would have agreed. They paid a "contribution" of xoo copper coins (mon) to the temple and left a small offering of rice in exchange for their permits. (138)
...
In Edo, however, up until 1659, all urban women were required to apply to the Keeper of Edo Castle (orusut), the officer in charge of Edo during the shogun's absence from the city. The 1659/6 order that changed this requirement created a unified system for commoners of both sexes.7 By allowing commoner women in Edo to obtain their permits from the City Magistrate, a lower ranking official, the bakufu greatly accelerated the application process. (138)
..
**in simplifying the procedures, they were reacting to the reality around them; and they tried to modify the application process to reflect that reality more closely**. (141)
..
Thus, for most male travelers, sekisho in themselves do not appear to have been a barrier to their mobility.(166)
..
It was because of the unsettling experience these women might encounter at major sekisho such as Hakone, Usui, Arai, and Kiso Fukushima that they sometimes sought alternate routes.(167) 
**less severe inspections**
	
#### Wanted the peasants to stay at their fields
Political authorities idealized a society where peasants remained fixed on the land, and thus they did not create a permit system meant to accommodate large numbers of travelers. The apparent result was a cumbersome system for obtaining permission to travel that they were never able to fully enforce.(172)
Early in the Tokugawa period pilgrimage retained much of the pure religious content it had in medieval Japan. But pilgrimage gradually developed as a form of recreation; pilgrims spent more time sightseeing on the way to and from the main pilgrimage site. As this happened, domains established regulations to try to curtail the length of travel. Limiting travel time, of course, decreased the amount of time a peasant would be away from his fields as well as the amount of money he would drain from the domain through travel expenditures (199)
**Tokugawa and their fellow daimyo idealized a society where most of the population remained tied to the land.** Thus, to see sekisho only in terms of the alternate attendance system is to overlook the general conditions of social fluidity and unrest in the early decades of the Tokugawa era. … **the Tokugawa travel permit system appears to have been the most developed**. (136)
..

#### Officials did try to change things
perhaps not readily apparent because their efforts were often reactive, government officials did attempt to create a system that would work…..even with that change, the system still could not fully accommodate the numbers of men and women wanting to travel. It appears that it was for this reason that the bakufu allowed religious institutions and landlords in urban areas, and religious institutions and village officials in rural areas, to issue permits for pilgrimages or trips to therapeutic hot springs. We say that government authorities "allowed" permit-issuing authority to devolve to a lower level because they almost never came out strongly against the practice. But why they failed to supervise or oversee the system leaves us puzzled. **The one attempt to reverse the process made by the bakufu in the I8Jos, requiring that all permits issued by village officials and religious institutions be coauthorized by intendants,** seems like a shot in the dark to assume control over a process with which it had theretofore not seemed overly concerned. In the domains, too, there is evidence that officials tried to make their permit systems more realistic by simplifying application procedures. This was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them on nukemairi. (173)




#Vaporis_1995 
## Vaporis 1995, The Early Modern Origins of Japanese Tourism

#### The popularity of tourism and travel
Kaempfer [1906, 2: 330], for example, wrote bf the "great numbers of people, who daily travel on the roads" and said that it was "owing partly to the Country's being extremely populous, partly to the frequent journies, which the natives undertake, oftener than perhaps any other nation, either willingly and out of their free choice, or because they are necessitated to it" 25
Kaempfer [1906, 2: 35] noted early on that the Japanese were "very much addicted to Pilgrimage." 25

#### Migration one reason for travel
urbanization and the redistribution of labor through migration" 25 were also reasons for travel/movement
leisure not born from the industrial revolution.

### What made it possible for the considerable scale of movement?
- Peace
- increase economy
- alternate attendance
- transport infrastructure

##### Road development
- Five Highways, or Gokaido (the Tokaido, Nakasendo, Osha kaido, Koshu kaido and Nikko kaido. (bakufu jurisdiction)

"While not foreseen by transport planners, the communications network in part made it possible for commoners to take to the roads in large numbers, and thus contributed to the development of travel and tourism." 27

Well developed, "The communications infrastructure was, in contemporary terms, well developed-an interpretation that is at odds with Meiji historical revisionism which has traditionally condemned various aspects of Tokuga,wa life as "feudal" or backward."27

"The absence of wheeled traffic, which was responsible for the great disrepair of contemporary European roads, is important in explaining why it was possible to maintain conditions in a better state in Tokugawa Japan." reason is "the problem of keeping traffic flow free of interruptions and roads in optimum condition for official travelers and communications." 27

##### Constraints

political
	the mechanisms of checking stations, or sekisho, and travel permits, for "control the movement of the defeated forces". 27
	This policy is popularly known as iri-demp6 ni de-onna, or "in-bound guns and out-bound women." Why block women?

economic
	monetary requirements of taking a recreational trip imposed a natural curb on that activity. Personal financial limitations,' however, could be overcome in part by participation in a religious confraternity (k6), in which economic resources were pooled to send a number of members on pilgrimage on a periodic basis" 30

social
	As pilgrimage was a principal Objective for travel by commoners, it is not surprising that most regulations were directed at it. Some of the ways in which domains sought to regulate pilgrimage were by: 1) setting certain economic qualifigations for the issuance of travel permits; 2) determining when and where travel was allowed; 3) determining who was allowed to travel; and 4) the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel.. Not every domain used all of these methods, but a number of them were common to many." 29
	..
	The best way to restrict the numbers leaving the domain on pilgrimage would' have been simply to ban it altogether. Nevertheless, only a small number of domains went so far as to take this unpopular step-and even then the ban was usually for a limited duration…When a domain government did prohibit pilgrimage, its motivation appears to have been primarily economic-to prevent the outfiow of domestic resources." 29
	While these cases are only from one diary, they are suggestive of the types of pressure brOught to bear upon women, even those on pilgrimage, during which social norms of expected behavior ordinarily were suspended." 30

##### What is Tourism?
Cohen defines a tourist as "a voluntary, temporary traveler, traveling in the expectation of pleasure from the novelty and change experienced on a relatively long and non-recurrent round-trip.""31

##### Against  tourism
"Government did not recognize the concept of tourism, and therefore discouraged all recreational or touristic travel. In Kaga (1708), for example, residents in rural areas were told that: "Sightseeing or the making of pilgrimages to temples in Kanazawa is of no worth (may6). The same is all the more true for long-distance travel."3) But because domains were more tolerant of pilgrimage to Ise, for many the trip there, whether officially sanctioned or not, became an excuse to travel" 32-33

"In the face of widespread flouting of the permit process and violations on bans on pilgrimage, domains seemed at a loss as to what to do." 33

Often don't actually go to Ise or only visit outer shrine

##### Similar to modern tourism

"While quite characteristic of modern tourism, it appears that Tokugawa tourists just as well could be more concerned or involved with "on-site markers"--for example, placards, plans, appropriate souvenirs--than the site,s themselves, "as though they were checking off a list of having truly visited the approved sights by the mere recognition of their markers" [GRABuRN 1983: 46] ." 34

"Yamamoto Mitsumasa's study of travel diaries shows that pilgrims tended to .follow set itineraries when sightseeing in Edo," 34

"For Kita and Yaji of Hizakurige. as well as the large number of named and anonymous travel diarists, it was as much the pleasures of the trip, the local delicacies, the entertainments, even the women, that made the trip worthwhile." 24

"For some stations (like Akasaka or Mishima), the prostitutes appear to have been the main attraction that drew travelers. As a bakiofu oMcial, Tanaka Kyagu, declared, "Those stations with them [i.e., prostitutes] prosper, those without them fall into economic decline."" 35

"Post stations and urban centers all had specialty products (meibutsu)-natural and cultural products as well as religious talismans-that provided nourishment to travelers or served as souvenirs and gifts." 35

also transport and baggage services

## Vaporis 2012 Linking the Realm: The Gokaidô Highway Network in Early Modern Japan
In *Highways, Byways, and Road Systems  2012*

#### Reasons for culture of travel
- literacy spread quickly
- prolonged peace meant safe travel
- improved economic conditions
- "highway network developed facilities that catered to the needs of commoners, travel became much more desirable"
- Good road conditions

- "Both political and economic elements were involved in the Tokugawa’s decision not to allow unrestricted use of carts, the end result of which was that road conditions were optimized and the possibility of traffic tie-ups minimized."

Tokugawa authority was also reflected by, and asserted through, the creation of a centralized road network, the Gokaidô (Figure 4.1), which was built at local expense and ran through the heart of the country, infringing on the sovereignty of those lords through whose territories it coursed. Central authority was further exercised through corvée labor requirements on the residents of those domains through which the roads passed; they were required to transport Tokugawa officials and cargo, thereby infringing on the daimyo’s right or ability to tax the people in their own domains (Vaporis 1986). 90-91

#### Limited movement of daimyo and samurai
they could no longer be masters of their own movements 91
Even outside of the system of alternate attendance, samurai could not move freely without the permission of their overlords, and usually their movements were in performance of duties to their daimyo overlord. Occasionally, they were given permission to travel for personal study and training in the martial arts. Some domains, however, banned outright recreational travel for them, and only in very rare cases were they given permission to travel to therapeutic hot springs. 93
Tokugawa and their fellow daimyo idealized a society where most of the population remained tied to the land 98
#### Ease of travel made possible by social and road conditions
All of this movement was only made possible by the elimination of many of the impediments to physical mobility that existed prior to the Tokugawa period, such as political fragmentation, warfare, social instability, mountain bandits, and the proliferation of economic tolls 93

A central aim of its policy was to keep traffic flowing, and the shogunate tried to achieve this by nationalizing the central road system, the Gokaidô, by abolishing private barriers or tolls, and by promulgating regulations that prohibited and discouraged the disruption of transport services.95

#### Roads weren't made for the population
the government did not always build roads where the people found them the most useful; the state’s purposes in building them and the people’s needs did not necessarily coincide…. conflict between official post stations and private operators over transport rights erupted rather often. 99

The Gokaidô was established for official rather than private use. However, once society was relatively peaceful and economic conditions improved, commoners were able to take advantage of the infrastructure, giving what had been essentially a military-political system an overwhelmingly plebeian character. The transport system was unexpectedly transformed in character through its use by the common people, particularly for travel as recreation. Travel-related facilities specifically geared for use by commoners – such as full-service as well as no-frills inns and teahouses – proliferated on the Gokaidô network during the seventeenth century, and a system developed by merchants for relaying correspondence was so efficient that even political authorities turned to it for routine business. This was one further indicator that the character of communications had changed. 99

  
with their improving financial lot, commoners could enjoy the same privileges as their social betters: they could engage porters, sedan chairs, and horses. 100

absence of the wheeled traffic…Restrictions on their usage seem to have been the result of the shogunate’s desire to prevent any interference with the flow of traffic (heavy carts are prone to spills) and the opposition of pack-horse operators, who felt their livelihoods were threatened. 101

The widespread use of side roads and the increasing reluctance of officials to discourage the practice, as well as the evidence for their greater leniency at checking stations. 102
