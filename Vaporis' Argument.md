## Vaporis 1994, Breaking Barriers, Travel and the State in Early Modern Japan


**bakufu economically motivated**
**The negative economic effects of travel gave reasons for bakufu and daimyo to want to discourage travel**
	the primary intent behind the relay system was economic: hence the bakufu's policy of discouraging sea transport, which would have allowed travelers to skip post stations and would reduce the amount of revenue they could raise through provision of transport services. (26)
	The application of Tokugawa law was at times unpredictable and random, but it could also be flexible, for it was a traditional principle in Japanese law that reason should prevail over custom and precedent (179)
	Sekisho were concerned primarily with the movement of people-particularly women-out ofEdo, contributing perhaps to the laxity with which other offenders were treated. Status was also a factor; while there are only two cases of samurai committing a sekisho-related offense, in both instances the samurai were made to suffer the death penalty. These cases, compared with those of commoners, emphasize the great distance that government maintained between status groups.  (181)
	**regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control**…There were limits to what the state could do to prohibit pilgrimage, which was widely accepted in society as a sacred act, and the evidence shows that the control measures instituted were generally ineffective. 
	…
	Perhaps the most common restrictions on any long-distance travel had to do with timing. Since travel during the agricultural season would take a peasant away from the land, in theory decreasing the agricultural output of a village, long-distance travel was generally restricted to the agricultural off-season, after taxes had been collected. (198)
	This illegal traffic was hurting business at Sekigawa and Nojiri, the post stations on either side of the sekisho that travelers bypassed. As a result, some officials from Nojiri apparently disabled or partially dismantled a bridge on the side road to stop the traffic, indicating that there were important economic reasons for travel restrictions. (190)
	..
	**Commoners evaded sekisho, it seems, without great concern about possible punishment, implying that the authorities gave tacit approval of the short-cuts or that punishment was rarely exacted**  (191)
	..
	Travel permits obtained indiscriminately while on one's journey defeated the primary purpose for which they were intended: that is, to provide a guarantee for the traveler's identity and behavior. Nevertheless, goverx:tment authorities did not come out strongly against the practice…It is clear that in many parts of the country, particularly in the north, travelers without permits could obtain passage through domain barriers, and at least some bakufu sekisho, for a fee. In some cases the money went towards the purchase of a permit, while in others the fee charged was in effect a toll. In this respect, Tokugawa barriers resembled those of the Middle Ages.69 In either case, however, it amounted to the same thingthe undermining of a control system  (196)
	...
	These economic requirements for travel were general conditions established by private domains and bakufu authorities. But, if we look closely at the requirements, they are not as strict as they appear, for they did not interfere with the flow of life. Not many responsible households would leave on an expensive journey with work to be done in the fields or with taxes unpaid. Consequently, these regulations seem to have been aimed more at commoners who would be more inclined to drop everything at a moment's notice to go on pilgrimage-servant personnel, temporary workers, and tenants. (199)
	..
	Early in the Tokugawa period pilgrimage retained much of the pure religious content it had in medieval Japan. But pilgrimage gradually developed as a form of recreation; pilgrims spent more time sightseeing on the way to and from the main pilgrimage site. As this happened, domains established regulations to try to curtail the length of travel. Limiting travel time, of course, decreased the amount of time a peasant would be away from his fields as well as the amount of money he would drain from the domain through travel expenditures (199)

**Money leaving domain**
	travelers commonly covered 40 kilometers a day (200)
	Domains in western Japan generally permitted relatively long periods of time for pilgrimage, which, judging by actual travel times, allowed extra time for sightseeing… In contrast, a number of eastern domains were strict with time limits, but gradually relaxed them
	..
	It is difficult to know to what we should attribute the fact that western domains were more generous than eastern ones. It could indicate a more lenient attitude in regulating the peasantry in Western Japan, or reflect the superior economic position of the populace in western domains. Time limits for eastern domains might have been gradually raised in an attempt to limit the length of trips of persons no longer obeying regulations. Or they could, instead, be seen as a reaction to better economic conditions. (200)
	..
	Nevertheless, the fact that punishment for abrogating time limits was rare lends support to the proposition that, with the generally improving economic conditions, Tokugawa commoners traveled more often and on longer journeys; and regulations tried to keep pace with that trend. (200-201)
	..
	To this end, copies of the Shikoku and Saikoku (Thirty!fhree Kannon Temple) circuits, as well as other popular pilgrimage routes and sites, W!'!re made within individual domains. The Aizu daimyo, for example, built an Ise Shrine, a Kumano Shrine, and a Thirty!fhree-Kannon Temple circuit right at home. A copy of the Saikoku or Western circuit was even created in the bakufu-controlled city of Osaka during the Genroku era. Together with establishing these would-be diversions, daimyo also tried to convince the people that worshipping outside the domain would mean that the local kami, or deities, were being neglected. (202)
	..
	Kaga restricted travel to Hongan-ji in Kyoto to once in a lifetime. **The reason authorities cited was the desire to stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver.** (202)
	..
	**Most prohibitions occurred from the mid-Tokugawa on, particularly after the turn of the nineteenth century, when fiscal problems worsened for many domains….Reasons given for bans in Yonezawa likewise were related to poor crops, drought, and inflation**. (203)
	..
	Daimyo were particularly leery of preventing people from worshipping at Ise; for in the words of Kaiho Seiryo, the late·1'okugawa political economist, such actions would cause the government to "lose the hearts of the people." (204)
	..
	The social acceptance of pilgrimage as a religious act as well as a rite of passage to adulthood could obviate the need for a permit, as the evidence on the Ise okagemairi demonstrates; and it could also protect many pilgrims from reprisals from those whose authority they had flouted by leaving without permission. (205)
	..
	Many people ran out of funds while traveling, especially to Ise, but resorted to less extreme measures than Saisaburo, taking out loans in order to return home. **Travel could thus set back some people even after they returned home-and a peasant who ruined himself financially hurt his domain's economy.** (209)
	..
	Officials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners….The physical and legal barriers erected by the state were insufficient to thwart commoners' desire to travel; although the government continued to keep these barriers in place, they gave their tacit and sometimes explicit approval to travelers who circumvented them (216)
	..
	**Tokugawa and their .fellow daimyo idealized a society where most of the population remained tied to the land.** Thus, to see sekisho only in terms of the alternate attendance system is to overlook the general conditions of social fluidity and unrest in the early decades of the Tokugawa era. … **the Tokugawa travel permit system appears to have been the most developed**. (136)
	..
	The eventual emergence of passports points to the growing popularity of travel, and reflects an easing of restrictions on commoner travel as well as the increasing ability of commoners to circumvent barriers erected to check their physical mobility

Example:
		Like many urban dwellers across the country, Kita and Yaji obtained their passports to travel on pilgrimage from their family temple, where their identities were on record. Being tenants, they also could have obtained them from their landlord; but since they owed him money, it is doubtful that he would have agreed. They paid a "contribution" of xoo copper coins (mon) to the temple and left a small offering of rice in exchange for their permits. (138)
	...
	In Edo, however, up until 1659, all urban women were required to apply to the Keeper of Edo Castle (orusut), the officer in charge of Edo during the shogun's absence from the city. The 1659/6 order that changed this requirement created a unified system for commoners of both sexes.7 By allowing commoner women in Edo to obtain their permits from the City Magistrate, a lower ranking official, the bakufu greatly accelerated the application process. (138)
	..
	**in simplifying the procedures, they were reacting to the reality around them; and they tried to modify the application process to reflect that reality more closely**. (141)
	..
	Thus, for most male travelers, sekisho in themselves do not appear to have been a barrier to their mobility.(166)
	..
	It was because of the unsettling experience these women might encounter at major sekisho such as Hakone, Usui, Arai, and Kiso Fukushima that they sometimes sought alternate routes.(167) 
**less severe inspections**
	
**Political authorities idealized a society where peasants remained fixed**
	on the land, and thus they did not create a permit system meant to accommodate large numbers of travelers. The apparent result was a cumbersome system for obtaining permission to travel that they were never able to fully enforce.(172)

**Officials did try to change things**
	perhaps not readily apparent because their efforts were often reactive, government officials did attempt to create a system that would work…..even with that change, the system still could not fully accommodate the numbers of men and women wanting to travel. It appears that it was for this reason that the bakufu allowed religious institutions and landlords in urban areas, and religious institutions and village officials in rural areas, to issue permits for pilgrimages or trips to therapeutic hot springs. We say that government authorities "allowed" permit-issuing authority to devolve to a lower level because they almost never came out strongly against the practice. But why they failed to supervise or oversee the system leaves us puzzled. **The one attempt to reverse the process made by the bakufu in the I8Jos, requiring that all permits issued by village officials and religious institutions be coauthorized by intendants,** seems like a shot in the dark to assume control over a process with which it had theretofore not seemed overly concerned. In the domains, too, there is evidence that officials tried to make their permit systems more realistic by simplifying application procedures. This was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them on nukemairi. (173)
