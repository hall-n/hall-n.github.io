#### Research on Hakuseki shogun advisor shows how authorities role was not at commoners' expense, and policies and focus changed with different administrations.

#### Understanding 
"shogunal autocracy" and "rationalized bureaucratic mechanism" characteristic of the early-eighteenth-century bakufu, but also our perception of the underlying dynamics of the Tokugawa system of rule (xi)

#### Not change in philosophy, but flexible reaction to changing economy
Hagiwara's career thus testifies to a continuity underlying the dramatic twists and turns that characterized the surface of bakufu monetary policy during these decades; it suggests that overall those twists and turns, including the Shiitoku move from debasement to restoration, reflect not so much the shift from one economic philosophy to another as a flexible pragmatism in trying to deal with the ongoing contradictions of the midTokugawa economy (105)

#### Hakuseki's policies
(1) policies concerning the fiscal foundations of bakufu rule; (2) approaches to the function and mechanism of governance; (3) measures pertaining to the symbolic definition of shogunal authority. (96)
##### Fiscal proved most enduring, shogunal didn't last long or were not implemented, and governance and administrative were mixed. 
Analysis of the first three issues will show that, contrary to what is often assumed, in these areas there was substantial congruence between Hakuseki's position and that of other influential figures within the bakufu. (96)


## Economy

#### Not at expense of people
Hakuseki's attention to the psychological dimensions of recoinage also probably had some impact on the procedures adopted for carrying out the restoration. Stressing the need for the bakufu to keep the confidence of the people if the restoration was to succeed, Hakuseki argued that the bakufu should not seek its own profit at the expense of the people, but should instead bear the cost of the recoinage. (101)
#### The economic issues more critical than political tensions
The magnitude of the economic issues of the early eighteenth century, however, transcended the structure of factional politics. The fact that currency restoration-and other economic reforms discussed below-was accomplished within the context of the polarized politics of Ietsugu's reign shows that the necessity to cope with immanent economic problems could foster a working resolution of the tension between the bakufu old guard and the shogunal circle. (105-106)

#### Concern with local administration changed according to administrations
Considered broadly, then, Hakuseki's approach to administration of the tenv6 fit into a general evolutionary trend running from the reign of Tsunayoshi to that of Yoshimune. It also, however, evidenced certain distinct features. The most striking of these was an ambivalence about development of the institutional framework necessary to establish effective central direction and coordination of local administration. The ~h6toku and Ky6h6 periods present a sharp contrast here. During the latter, significant steps were taken to rationalize the operation of the kunjG bugy6 and to bring local administration under tighter central control. By comparison, relatively little of a concrete nature was achieved in this area during the Shatoku period....They reflected an underlying orientation to governance quite different from that which took shape under Yoshimune. We can begin to get a sharper sense of this difference by considering Hakuseki's views on one final matter pertinent to fiscal administration: rationalization of the post-station system. (123)

#### Coinage
THE BACKGROUND OF DEBASEMENT AND RECOINAGE. While sharp shifts in monetary policy characterized the four decades between the 1690s and 1730s, one factor was constant: a shortage of precious metals available for coinage. By common calculation the bakufu, in its early years, possessed enormous metallic wealth. Ieyasu left substantial amounts of gold and silver to his descendants, and the output of the bakufu gold and silver mines compensated for the portion of his legacy used up by Hidetada and Iemitsu. But, by the end of Iemitsu's reign in 1651, the output of the mines had dropped sharply. To meet the bakufu's financial needs, bakufu administrators turned to minting the reserves left by Ieyasu. By 1680, when Ietsuna's reign ended, the ordinary reserves had been exhausted, and minting began of the special store of ingots Ieyasu had set aside for use only for a military emergency.
debasement of the currency begun in 1695...Moreover, although its immediate purpose was to enlarge bakufu income, debasement had the side effect of expanding the supply of money at a time when existing currency resources could not keep up with the demands created by commercialization of the economy-one of the by-products of peace and the Tokugawa system of rule.3 (98)


## Post Stations
#### Overview by local officials
The post station residents were also expected to transport for certain fixed fees the daimyo and their retinues and other specified "official" groups. To provide the post-station population with the livelihood necessary to support their performance of these obligations, they were allowed to contract on the side to transport private individual^.'^ Immediate responsibility for seeing that each post-station performed its specified function lay with resident commoner officials. The operation of the system as a whole was supervised over the years by various bakufu offices, most notably the *ometsuke* (inspectors general), responsible, among other things, for overseeing matters having to do with security and communications with the daimyo, and the *kanjo* offices. Beginning in 1659, one dmetsuke was officially appointed to act as d~chii bugyd (magistrate of roads); from 1698 on, a kanj~ bugya also served concurrently as ddchii bugy6.71 (124)
In particular the temptation was great for the inhabitants of the poststations to pass provision of the obligatory services off on the sukegd villages and to concentrate themselves on supplying the more lucrative private transport services (124-125)
The emergence of these problems pointed up the need for a more effective means of supervising the operation of the transport mechanism. (125)

#### Confusianist thought
The traditional Confucian suspicion of delegating responsibility to those who by definition lacked the qualities essential to the good official helps explain Hakuseki's lack of enthusiasm for rationalization of the system of local administration. The traditional Confucian suspicion of delegating responsibility to those who by definition lacked the qualities essential to the good official helps explain Hakuseki's lack of enthusiasm for rationalization of the system of local administration. (127)
his view of personnel matters does not conform fully to the classic Confucian premise that the first step to reforming society is to find good men to govern. Equally important, the nature of his own position also inclined him to be dubious about bureaucratic rationalization....This circumstance, as well as Confucian theory, worked to make him play down the mechanics of extending central control over local administration even as he pursued the formulation of "negative" regulation designed to reduce the independence of local officials and the definition of standards which would remind local officials of their accountability to higher authority (128)
