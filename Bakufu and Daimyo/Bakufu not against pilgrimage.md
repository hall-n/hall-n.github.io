### Bakufu not against pilgrimage AMBROS
- The bakufu did not oppose female pilgrims but was concerned that they were bypassing official checkpoints 
- Bakufu didn't try to prevent such pilgrimages,  unless they showed bad behavior or made their journey too long

The steady, community-building aspects of the pilgrimage to Ōyama reinforced values of social harmony; hence, the bakufu placed few obstacles in its way. The few regulations that pertained to it were not so much meant to limit the pilgrimage to Ōyama but more to ensure that pilgrims did not extend their pilgrimages unduly and maintained order on their journeys. They were either issued to prevent pilgrims to Mt. Fuji from continuing their already lengthy journey to Ōyama, or to curb the competition faced by station towns from other villages near the Tōkaidō, or to deal with times of crisis, such as in the 1860s when sea routes near Edo could have brought not only harmless pilgrims but also insurgents from the north.82 In contrast to the negative attitude of some domains toward the pilgrimages to the Ise Shrines and to Shikoku, neither the bakufu nor the pilgrims’ home communities considered the journey to Ōyama subversive
