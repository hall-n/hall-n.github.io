Freedom from Edo jidai restrictions ^d81d9f

Blacker 1994 points out that the changes in roads and ease of travel isn't enough to explain the surge in travel



Offers freedom from restricted everyday Edo jidai ^87cc86
	In Edo society, as the restrictions of the han became ever greater, as the volume of edicts prohibiting you from doing this or that became more minute, the image of the traveller to another realm beckoned with an insistence never felt when 'home' was a safe refuge from a featureless unknown. The featureless unknown becomes a new world with a sacred goal, alight with all the symbols of a paradise beyond. Hence not only does the pilgrim project the image of the holy wanderer to the outside world. His own motive in setting out on the journey likewise reflects something of the same pull which took the yugyosha out of the social order, of an escape from the world and everything it stands for into a state of detachment and blissful freedom from ties. **The pilgrimage is the external counterpart of an inner journey towards a centre within.** The Edo pilgrim when he embarked on a trip which was an escape from the world of petty restrictions, may have at the same time dimly sensed the same objective, the 'buddha in this very body', which so powerfully inspired the men in the tradition from Gyogi to Jitsukaga.

	Exposure to local culture through visits to these culturally significant sites, as well as more ludic attractions, contributed to the pilgrim’s sense of temporary freedom from the constraints of everyday life, namely one’s occupation, social status, and gender—and helps explain why the sacred and profane intermingled so freely in the context of Edo-period travel. 8
