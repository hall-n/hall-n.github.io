Freedom from Edo jidai restrictions ^d81d9f

Blacker 1994 points out that the changes in roads and ease of travel isn't enough to explain the surge in travel


Difficulty of travel
	The new sekisho erected by the Tokugawa were not, as a rule, in spots which hindered pilgrimage to any of the popular shrines and in any case were not intended to exact money in tolls. (593)
	But a mere improvement in roads and hotels is not enough to account for the extraordinary increase, among classes of society which had hitherto scarcely stirred out of their villages or towns, in the desire to 'go on pilgrimages'. Why should farmers and merchants, not to speak of craftsmen and samurai, wish to embark on what was still an arduous, uncomfortable, expensive and often hazardous journey to a distant holy place?

Offers freedom from restricted everyday Edo jidai ^87cc86
	In Edo society, as the restrictions of the han became ever greater, as the volume of edicts prohibiting you from doing this or that became more minute, the image of the traveller to another realm beckoned with an insistence never felt when 'home' was a safe refuge from a featureless unknown. The featureless unknown becomes a new world with a sacred goal, alight with all the symbols of a paradise beyond. Hence not only does the pilgrim project the image of the holy wanderer to the outside world. His own motive in setting out on the journey likewise reflects something of the same pull which took the yugyosha out of the social order, of an escape from the world and everything it stands for into a state of detachment and blissful freedom from ties. **The pilgrimage is the external counterpart of an inner journey towards a centre within.** The Edo pilgrim when he embarked on a trip which was an escape from the world of petty restrictions, may have at the same time dimly sensed the same objective, the 'buddha in this very body', which so powerfully inspired the men in the tradition from Gyogi to Jitsukaga.
