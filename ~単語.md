### Policies

鎖国　*sakoku*　 which prohibited Japanese from traveling abroad

参勤交代　*sankin kõtai*　regional lords were required to reside in alternate years at the capital, Edo

土地緊縛　*tochi kinbaku* 　attempted to control and limit the movement of ordinary people
	"tightly binding (the ordinary people) to the land" (Kouame 414)

*sukego seido*　post-village system
	People and goods were transported using the post relay system and it was centrally coordinated by the mediatprs who were called tonbea. Carriers and horses were always ready for use at the mediators' yards and the fares were decided･ by weighing the goods. When labour and horses were in short supply, workers and horses were recruited from surrounding villages. (Kanzaki 1995)

*bakuhan taisei*　 bakuhan system
	The political structure established by the Tokugawa house in the early years of the seventeenth century 
	The key elements in this connection was: 
	-  legally defined farming class *hyakusho*
	-  the designation of village officials such as the headmen *nanushi, shoya* 
	-  the placement of the daimyo's regional field administrators *daikan or koribugyo*
### Stations

関所　*sekisho*

番所　*bansho*

*shukuek*i　post station
	refer to both the station where the transpon services were offered and to the larger settlement of which it was sometimes a pan (referred to at times as shukubamachi. Both Japanese terms are used interchangeably, although the distinction is important in large, multi-functional settlements." Vaporis 1994

*oshi* 　innkeeper-proselytizers

### Permits
手形　paper, bill

sekisho 手形  permit
- Sekisho transit permits were issued for passage through a particular sekisho. When stopping before the main office for inspection, the traveler handed over the permit and, if it was in order, went on his way. Such permits were issued by designated bakufu officials as well as daimyo and their officials. Vaporis 1994
- transit permits can be found from as early as the second decade of the seventeenth century

Orai　手形：passports 
- Passports, on the other hand, could be used for as many sekisho and, in many cases, domain bansho, as the traveler passed through on his journey without surrendering it. Passports were issued by village and post station officials, shrines and temples, and sometimes even innkeepers. Vaporis 1994
- did not come into common use until the middle of the Edo period

	The content of this document was quite standardized: name and address of the pilgrim, information about his/her family’s temple and sectarian affiliation, definition of the purpose of the trip, and various clauses relating to the treatment of the pilgrim in case of illness or death. The following is a translation of a typical õrai tegata: 
		Travel Permit
		Kanamonoya Rihei, from Shinmachi of the castle town of Matsumoto, Shinano Province (present-day Nagano Prefecture). We attest that the above-named person’s family has for generations been a parishioner of the Jõdo sect and our temple. He is applying to go on a pilgrimage to Shikoku to ful³ll a vow. As we recognize his will, we present a travel permit to him. Please let him pass through the barrier stations of the provinces without hindrance. When night falls he will ask to stay the night. If he should fall ill and die, please bury him according to the rites of the local priest. In such a case it will not be necessary to inform his home province.
