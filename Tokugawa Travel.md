# Why could flourish


 - Road conditions
    - Centralized network
    - increase in checkpoint town 
services, from daimyo travel but 
later grew to target commoner 
travelers.
    - abolishment of tolls and private
barriers
 - Shogunate forbade travel by
carriage, thus travel on foot could
be done by anyone
 - Travel arduous but no longer
dangerous due to peace
 - literacy riate increased, access to
maps and travel diaries and poems
 - improved economic conditions
    - travel costs money, commoners
now have financial leeway
 - Blacker argues ease and economic 
changes not enough, as travel is 
not easy. **Suggests sacral image of wanderer**

# [Merchants](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/2931713917)

 - Shogunate founded on Neo-Confucianism
 - Pursuit of commerce led them to
abandon Confucian framework.
    - **Did the rulers follow along when they saw the profits?**
 - Viewed merchant’s world being
based on trust and honesty
 - The scholars of the Kaitokudo
educated people regardless of
status or wealth or age

# [Bakufu & daimyo](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/2928573989)

 - Economic: money leaving domain
    - Wouldn't money coming in be
attractive?
 - Confusian idea that leisure wasn't
good
    - though some han had no objection 
if travel was on the off-season. 
Therefore **confusian ethics not relevant?**
 - tolerant of pilgrimages to Ise
    - supports emperor and shogunate?
 - tolerant of medical reasons, saw
onsen as legitimate treatment
 - Visualized people being tied to
land

# [Reality at checkpoints](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/2928579448)

 - While rules seem strict, ultimately
final deision left up to checkpoint
staff
    - tried to make permit system more
realistic
        - in order to encourage commoners
to apply, insead of nukemairi. **in other words, to follow the system**
 - Huge inflow of travelers
 - Strict with punishments for samurai,
while lax with commoners
    - movement out of Edo, particularly
of women, more strict than to Edo.
