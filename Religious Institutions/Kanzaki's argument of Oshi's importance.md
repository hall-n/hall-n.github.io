The oshi were originators of tourism in Japan ^8c338a

A desire to travel is common to all human beings, but travel thrives only because institutions and facilities for travel were well equipped and the society stable (40)

Transportation policies of Edo were comprehensive, and most importantly, they made accommodation facilities common

same time, alternate attendance system meant farmers were seeing lords travel frequently.

This showed travelling as a symbol of high status. 

Thus common people "could not help wanting"(42) to travel

>The reality was, that the bakufu and daimyo could not totally ban travel by the common people when they themselves traveled frequently. (42) 

**assumes they wanted to ban?**


Travelling still time consuming, not easy, and expensive.
Therefore commoners pooled together to make group travel.

Points out the importance of the Oshi.

Belief system of the nobles spread among commoners.
the oshi originally missionaries but became more merchants than priests, each with their own territory

Points out the high level of hospitality provided by oshi 

>The same style of entertainment continued after the oshi became independent from the shrine and started to do business with ordinary people, in the Edo period, but underneath the hospitality lay a cunning business spirit. . What they intended was advertisement with maximum effect. (48)

>the oshi may be regarded as the originators of the tourist industry in Japanï¼Ž(49)
