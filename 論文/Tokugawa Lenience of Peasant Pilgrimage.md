%%Increase in tourism. Many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and travel, implementing a system of barriers to impede their movement, barriers which the peasants found ways to circumvent. Other research into travel and the permit system, however, reveals that both the daimyo and bakufu were clearly tolerant towards allowing peasants to travel, showing hesitance to enforce the laws that controlled peasants mobility. 

the bakufu was reluctant to enforce travel limitations on peasants.

the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it
I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the 

commercialization of travel  economic motivations behind travel promotion which gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a

assumption that the authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants and does not take into account the economic benefits that the tourism from pilgrimage brought. The bakufu and daimyo's position was not authoritarian, but was focused on keeping their region prosperous. Using recent research that reveals cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that as long as travel did not negatively effect the peasant's production, the bakufu and daimyo had more reason to allow its practice because pilgrimage brought commerce due to its tourist nature. This explanation of the authorities' economic objective explains why they took steps to keep travel within reason, seeking to eliminate *nukemairi* pilgrimages which had a negative effect on the regions while making permits for ?? more easily obtainable.  

the economic motivations that lie behind both the travel agent like oshi who encouraged peasants to travel and the

combined with the bakufu's position of being a "benevolent'" ruler gave them less incentive to stop the peasants from traveling than it did to simply manage the system to keep up with the sudden surge of pilgrimage travel.

I argue that the bakufu and daimyo position towards peasant travel was not to confine farmers to their lands, but to ensure that their movement did not have a negative economic effect. This explains why they responded to the surge in travel by making proper travel permits easier to obtain.%%

# Thesis
## Introduction (850-1000 words)
As Japan entered an era of peace in the beginning of the Tokugawa period, the bakufu took steps to ensure that daimyo would not have the means of uprising against the newfound government, implementing the alternate attendance system which required daimyo to make regular trips to Edo. In order to facilitate this compulsory travel, the bakufu instituted extensive infrastructure, building a centralized road network and positioned barrier stations, or *sekisho*, along its route in order to monitor movement. To ensure that traffic flowed smoothly, the roads were regularly cleaned, wheels that would damage the road surface were banned, and trees and shrubs were planted along the side of the road to provide shade and wind cover. The bakufu also established post stations that offered lodging, food, and travel services. While these services had to prioritize servicing Tokugawa officials and daimyo, they were allowed to cater to the lower classes.  

At the same time that the conditions for travel were greatly improved, the lower classes of peasants and merchants began to find themselves with increasing financial freedom, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">which made travel more viable and led to a boom in pilgrimage (Ishimori 2009). </mark>In order to pass through the many *sekisho* barriers along the highway, however, one needed to have a permit. Such a permit would not be issued for simply travel for pleasure, but a journey for the purpose of pilgrimage or visiting an onsen for health reasons was permissible (Goree 2020). As advances in media captured the appeal of travel, describing famous sights and attractions with many traveler guidebooks being published, pilgrimage became increasingly popular. Over time, sightseeing and enjoying local specialties began to common elements, sometimes even turning into the primary focus of the pilgrimage itself (REF). Thus the commoner was able to take advantage of the travel infrastructure and out of growing pilgrimage soon arose a booming a tourism industry.

Despite the evident popularity of pilgrimage and sightseeing among commoners, however, many historians have argued that the bakufu and daimyo authorities were negatively positioned against peasant travel, claiming that since it had negative economical impact and the anti-structural elements, that pilgrimage was seen by the bakufu as subversive and therefore posed a threat to their authority (Traganou 2004, REF). 

Against this argument, however, there is increasing evidence that the bakufu and daimyo were lenient in allowing travel of the lower classes (Ambros 2008, Thal 2005). In the research of Vaporis (1994, 1995, 2012), which made significant contributions to the study of Tokugawa travel, he overturns previous assumptions of the government's nature of being authoritarian, intrusive, and closely regulating all aspects of society (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REF</mark>). Vaporis observes that the checkpoint officials dealt with travelling peasants with an increasing measure of laxity, in contrast to the strictness they showed samurai and upper classes. In fact, he argues, the changes that the bakufu make to the permit system made pilgrimage applications more flexible and easily obtained by peasants, a change that appears to be done in order to encourage travelers to apply for permits. Vaporis concludes, therefore, that while the bakufu made certain restrictions of travel, the peasants found ways to circumvent these barriers and thus were not immobile. 

While Vaporis' argument challenges the fact that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, he positions as is if that is despite the intent or against the desire of the authorities. This paper presents an alternative perspective. I argue that the economic benefits to be gained from pilgrimage is highly relevant to understanding the lenience of the bakufu and daimyo because "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (Thal 2005, 102). This market economy was of great importance to the bakufu, as my previous research (Hall 2022) revealed in their efforts to manage the rice market and increase yield production. Building on these observations, I argue that the bakufu's concern with the economic potential of pilgrimage is because the governance of the Tokugawa regime was not authoritarian, but socially responsive ( #Paramore_2012 ) and primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity. This approach stemmed from the structural changes and acceptance of Confusicanism's ethics of benevolent rule that the Tokugawa regime implemented in order to solidify their position as shogunate. Therefore, because they were more focused on keeping a prosperous country andsought the well-being of the people, they would be approving of the rise of the tourism industry from pilgrimage.

In order to make the connection between the bakufu's lenience and their economic priorities, a review of the situation surrounding that pilgrimage is necessary. Beginning with a review of the arguments made by historians regarding the Tokugawa and daimyo authorities' perspective of pilgrimage, first an examination of how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry. This research reveals that the religious institutions looked to pilgrims for financial support, and their promotion of pilgrimage to religious sites led to the surrounding regions competing for the business of pilgrims. Next, analyzing the authorities' response to this industry reveals their underlying objective of keeping pilgrimage from harming the region and surrounding communities, while at the same time ensuring that business could sufficiently profit from it. In addition, observing how the bakufu and Shikoku daimyo dealt with what has been argued to be potentially subversive and antisocial pilgrims (Blacker 1984, Traganou 2004) reveals that the Shikoku authorities constrained pilgrimage in order to keep it from adversely affecting the region while offering medical and other support which the bakufu had instituted in order to help pilgrims in need. This research outlines the fact that the bakufu and local daimyo authorities were only positioned against pilgrimage when it was disruptive and took steps not ensure it proceeded smoothly. Finally, from these observations I argue that the reason for such a position lies in the style of ethical governance that slowly began to dominate the Tokugawa period (Paramore 2012). Looking at the "benevolent authoritarianism" (Hall 1966) of a common style of daimyo rule and how economic thought began to influence the daimyo (Robert 1998), I argue that the response of the authorities to pilgrimage was not a position against it, but keeping it within reasonable boundaries while allowing it to grow the community. Therefore, the lenience toward pilgrimage of the lower classes by the bakufu, and by extension the daimyo, was because they were primarily concerned with the economy and recognized that pilgrimage could further the region's prosperity.

%%
Following this, an examination of **how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry.** Using studies that look closely at the development of pilgrimage reveals that the economic potential of these travelers was realized by the shrine and temples Oshi, who promoted and organized pilgrim's travel and organize travel for pilgrims (Kanzaki 1995). Their efforts resulted in the direct increase of pilgrims (Ambros 2008) and over time other local entities began to vie for the service of those travelers, creating a competitive market. This research emphasizes just how vital the tourism industry that emerged from pilgrimage came to be for many regions of Japan.
Next, an analysis of **how authorities respond to this industry** reveals that in many cases where communities take steps to allow and support pilgrimage travel they are met with positive responses from authorities (Ambros 2008, Kouamé 1997,  Thal 2005). In cases where the authorities attempt to restrict pilgrimage (Vaporis ?), the main factor in the authorities' actions appears to be for the purpose of limiting the negative economic effect of pilgrimage that it had towards the surrounding region. I argue that in both of these cases reflect the authorities' concern with the economy; therefore they limit pilgrimage when it has negative affect on region and allowing it when the effect is positive or neutral. 
Finally, I argue that the reason the **Tokugawa authorities were primarily concerned with the economy was due to their style of governance** that realized the overall benefit in ensuring prosperity of the lower class. This can be traced back to the beginning of Edo period when they restructured the rice tax and prioritized agricultural development, even at the sake of improving the quality of life for the commoners. 
research of Tokugawa bakufu and daimyo governance reveals a trend of moving away from authoritarian methods and instead allowing the lower classes to be prosperous. As the entire tax system was based on the efforts of the farmer, this would result in their own prosperity.
To support this argument I present research that reveals the bottom-up style of governance that looks more democratic than authoritarian (Paramore 2012), and research that shows benevolent ruling was becoming more common and linked to a region's prosperity (Hall 1966). While this research might argue that the basis for this style of governance was largely based in Confucianism, another possibility is that it simply was more economically rewarding for the rulers. As my previous research on the rice tax revealed, the bakufu saw it in their own wellbeing to benevolently leave the peasants with a surplus, because it led to an overall increase in rice tax and an increase in other commodities. 

I believe this to represent their overall priority and interest in the economy.

From the findings of this research, I argue that the economic potential of pilgrimage, which was exploited by the religiously affiliated oshi, popularized by media and enhanced by the competition of regional businesses, was also understood by the bakufu a became a determining factor in how they, and subsequently the regional authorities, responded to pilgrimage. The tourism industry intertwined in/of pilgrimage was greatly important to the regions and therefore would also be important to the rulers, as it was in their best interest to ensure the region's economic prosperity.

### Argument by Historians (Watkins, Blacker, Traganou)
In much of the literature on travel during the Edo period there is an overall perception that the bakufu and daimyo held a position against pilgrimage, wishing to restrict unnecessary movement of the peasants ( #Kanzaki_1995, #Vaporis_2012, #Watkins_2008). While many of the historians that present this perspective do not elucidate on why the authorities would be adverse to this travel, others claim that the bakufu and daimyo perceived pilgrimage to be a threat due to its negative social aspects (Blacker 1984, Traganou 2004). Traganou (2004) claims that pilgrimage meant abandoning one's occupation and was used as an escape from the restrictions Edo period society.  
%%She points out that this abandonment was reflected in the attire that the pilgrims wore; a white or sleeveless garment and sedge hat %%

Likewise, Blacker (1984) #Blacker_1984  argues that undertaking such travel meant that farmers were neglecting their proper duty, thus the daimyo viewed pilgrimage as "frivolous, useless, extravagant and immoral" (ibid, 604). Though Blacker does admit that some daimyo did not object pilgrimages which were undertaken during the idle part of the year, she nevertheless claims that the authorities saw this traveler as playing no useful part in human society and a threat to order and stability,  However, looking at how Blacker views the pilgrim reveals a wandering mendicant who whished to escape from the rules of society, a perspective that places considerable weight on a single pilgrim architype. This antisocial element that both Traganou and Blacker claim to be the root of the authorities' concern is not necessarily an element of all pilgrimages, as Ambros (2008) argues in her research of pilgrimage in the Kanto region.

**Economic**
Other arguments that explain the authorities position against pilgrimage point to the negative economical factors that such travel brought. Traganou (2004) argues that pilgrimage could interfere with the farmer's agricultural production, to which both the bakufu and daimyo's finances were directly tied. In addition, some pilgrimages upset the local economies, "causing inflation of the prices of rice, straw, lodgings and other necessities" (ibid, 72). In contrast to this argument, however, Ambros argues that popular pilgrimage destinations often develop the infrastructures needed to deal with the influx of pilgrims as commercialism becomes a part of pilgrimage. \
Another negative economical impact of pilgrimage that is mentioned is the loss of domain financial resources. Vaporis explains how travelling into other regions meant that money would be leaving the domain %% caused concern for the ruler%%, pointing to the example of the Kaga domain restricting pilgrimage to a popular Kyoto shrine, claiming it was to "stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver" ( #Vaporis_1994, 202). 

**Reality**
Despite the above reasons which stress the unwanted nature of pilgrimage, the reality was that the legislature towards it "appears to have been merely a reaction to the social reality that existed and thus, in a sense, was little more than sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 12). In Vaporis's study of the road barriers the travel permit system of the Tokugawa period, he challenges the idea that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, and argues that the peasants found ways to circumvent the barriers. He finds the reality at the road barriers to reveal their tolerance of travel and flexibility of the system, describing the many cases of laxity where checkpoint officials allowed passage for peasants without permits or letting slide permit related offenses. 
Looking at the government policies regarding travel, Vaporis concludes that they were "on the whole, positive rather than repressive" and quite flexible. "This growing flexibility in a system that originally had been more rigid allowed for - and in fact promoted - the increasing mobility that characterized Tokugawa Japan from the eighteenth century on" (Vaporis 1994, 5). Vaporis therefore argues against accepting a "legalistic interpretation of Tokugawa Japan" (6), as doing so overestimates the state's authority and incorrectly represents peasants as immobile, with their movements severely restricted and strictly inspected at barriers. His conclusion is that despite the intention of the authorities, the *sekisho* barriers did not significantly impede peasant travelers (ibid, 7). He observes that "regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control" ( #Vaporis_1994, 198). Furthermore, contrary to the idea of dealing with the commoners harshly, "[o]fficials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners" (Vaporis 1994, 216). 
These observations reveal that historians presuppositions about the bakufu's method of dealing with the peasants needs reassessing, as they clearly are not adverse to the pilgrimage of commoners. However, the question of why the authorities were so lax in allowing pilgrimage is one that Vaporis does not ask, as Nosco has noted in his review of Vaporis' work. #Nosco_1996. The arguments of Vaporis that touches on the *intent* of the bakufu come much in line with Blacker and Traganou, describing in length the restrictions and troubles the pilgrims meet with when they pass the barrier and arguing how the authorities envisioned the peasants being tied to the land. As both the bakufu and daimyo's income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities. Overall the works of Vaporis eludes an image of the bakufu as if they are positioned against pilgrimage but unable to stop it, thus they show leniency to a fight they cannot win. He concludes that "regulations, while not without some effect, were not able to stem the irrepressible desire of the masses in Tokugawa Japan to travel" ( Vaporis 1994, 198). 

The examples of actions against pilgrimage presented by Vaporis and other historians appears to be to limit its negative economic effects, were the authorities really trying to stem the desire to travel? 

I would argue that allowing peasants to acquire permits more easily reveals their underlying motivation to stem pilgrimage that could harm a region's economy while promoting pilgrimage that could positively increase that economy. Indeed, Vaporis even observes some domains regulating pilgrimage by "setting certain economic qualifications for the issuance of travel permits, determining when and where travel was allowed, determining who was allowed to travel, and establishing the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel"  ( Vaporis 1994, 198). While he positions this as if it reflects the authorities' position against pilgrimage, I would argue that it shows their acceptance of it as they try to keep it within reasonable bounds. In contrast to the arguments above, pilgrimage overall had a positive economic impact the industry surrounding the tourism that came from it became important for many regions of Edo period Japan. In order to see that impact in perspective, a review of the factors that led to pilgrimage travel being commercialized. behind the rise of tourism.

%%This paper seeks to answer the questions that Vaporis' research reveals but which are left largely unasked; why the bakufu and daimyo authorities were so permissive of pilgrimage if it was argued to be so disruptive to society and threatened the ruler's authority and damaging to the economy? If were are to assume that the authorities were positioned against travel, why do we observe such lenience towards it? %% 

%%Countless persons from all social ranks defied governmental authority by traveling without official permission despite the volumes of legislation intended to regulate or restrict movement. (Vaporis 1994, 12)%%

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. 

Rather than come out against pilgrimage with strong measures and enforced punishments, government authorities were content to issue and re-issue prohibitiens which were hortatory in nature and thereby functioned more as sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 215)


Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain.

### Commercialization of Pilgrimage 
In recent years, historians have approached the topic of Edo period travel from many different angles, asking new questions about why pilgrimage became so widely practiced, how travelers interacted with their destinations, and how their travels turned into what we recognize today as contents tourism ( #SeatonEtal_2017) . While some elements of this tourism dates back to the before the Nara period, such as the buying of amulets and travel souvenirs, the commercialization of travel grew to new heights during the Edo period to "become the dominant medium through which places were experienced" (Wigen 2010, 298) by consumer pilgrims (Nenzi 2004).
%%The key element to these changes were the efforts of the religious institutions. %%
#### Promotion of Pilgrimage for Financial Gain (Kanzaki, Tadao, Thal)
Examining in more detail the factors that led to the rise of pilgrimage reveals the economic motivations of parties who worked to popularize pilgrimage, as they sought to gain financially from it. The instigators of that promotion are what have been described as the first travel agents: the temple and shrine affiliated *oshi* ( #Kanzaki_1995 Kanzaki 1995, 49). In the beginning of the Edo period, the religious institutions began to lose financial support from the bakufu, and in an attempt to compensate for this they worked to attract pilgrims to shrines and temples. In Ambros's research (2008) of the Ōyama, a mountain shrine and temple complex located in the Kanagawa Prefecture, she argues that these oshi were the key players in growing the popularity of pilgrimage, and it was due directly to the their efforts that the Ōyama religious site transformed into such a major tourist destination, with X people visiting (REF).

These Oshi appealed to pilgrims by arranging for the travelers' accommodation, providing tour guides, and offering useful travel information  ( #Tadao_1995, 6). While originally much like a missionary on behalf of their shrine or temple, over time they "became more merchants than priests, each with their own territory" ( #Kanzaki_1995, ?). A major element of the oshi's promotion was the level of hospitality and entertainment that they offered pilgrims, such as preparing luxurious silk bedding and providing extravagant banquets that made use of the local gastronomic specialties. They also offered tours and presented souvenirs and gifts to the pilgrims. However, underneath this "hospitality lay a cunning business spirit. What they intended was advertisement with maximum effect ( #Kanzaki_1995, 48)". After the pilgrims returned to their village, they would talk about the luxury they enjoyed and this would lead to additional pilgrim recruitment for the Oshi. 

"Temples and shrines sponsored this growth for the sake of economic advantage by making recreational goods and services available within or just beyond their gates" (Goree 2020, 8). Thus, the
The financial gain that came from pilgrimage was not something that was felt by shrines and temples alone, however. While talismans and religious offerings were important elements of one's pilgrimage, the commerce potential of pilgrims was much larger. An example of this is *meibutsu*, which became an important element for travelers, with locations advertising their local specialty cuisine as a marketing strategy in order to promote their popularity. Nenzi observes that the creation of many popular travel destinations was owed specifically to the presence of a *meibutsu* (2004, 302). "Gastronomies and knickknacks provided a convenient way to forge a link with a travel destination for those who did not wish to experiment with the ethereal and often slippery pillow words of poetic travel" (Nenzi 2008, 155). No longer did formal education preclude the traveler "from symbolically “owning” a site—all it took now was a string of coins and, sometimes, an appetite" (ibid). The consumption of these non-religious elements grew to be widely popular, and to the demand of the pilgrims, the tourism industry responded with merchandise "Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement" (ibid 156). 
Souvenirs to bring back to the pilgrim's hometown had become an important aspect of the trip itself, as it gave validation of one's travels and offered the experience with those of the village who could not visit themselves. Similar to tourism in modern day Japan, a wide variety of industries took advantage of they link their to the region or religious site and marketed themselves as *meibutsu*. Among souvenirs from the pilgrimage at Marugame, for example, the advertisements listed not only locally made fans that had an association with the local diety but also oil and miso. They also offered patent medicines such as "Mt. Zozu Kongobo's renowned Konjinmaru" and "Konshotan" (Thal 2005, 102).  
It was not physical products alone that took advantage of pilgrims, howevever. Teahouses and brothels quickly became popular stops on one's pilgrimage, with some prostitutes becoming famous *meibutsu* themselves (REF).

The production of travel information grew with (REF)

Therefore the effects of pilgrimage were felt far beyond the industry of travel, and created a situation of competition between regional businesses and religious sites. From that competition, there did arise cases of conflict, but far from pilgrimage's negative effect on the region, they serve to outline just how vital pilgrimage became. 

An example of this can be seen in Nenzi's .... 


#### Consumerist Pilgrims (Nenzi, Thal)

Explores the political and socioeconomic dimensions of pilgrimage Thal, Ambros, Nenzi


Just how big of an industry pilgrimage became for some regions can be seen in Nenzi's research (2004) into the interactions of pilgrims and their destinations during the Edo period. Using as a case study the region of Sagami, located in modern day Kanagawa prefecture, Nenzi traces the many cases of conflict between regional parties who competed for profits from these pilgrims. To resolve this conflict, those parties turned to the regional governments and Edo authorities to stop practices that resulted in the decline of pilgrim visitors.

In one example from 1650, the head of a temple of the goddess Benzaiten in Enoshima complained that local fisherman were selling the deity's amulets and leading travelers to their own establishments, instead of telling them how to reach the temple's lodgings. This resulted in a loss of income for the temple, thus they petitioned the shrine and temple magistrate in Edo to put a stop to what they felt were illegitimate inns. The response from the magistrate was a compromise, allowing the private non-temple affiliated inns to be run when there was an overflow of travelers which the temple could not accommodate. As for the amulet distribution, it could continue as long as "those who benefited from it also provide services to the temple" (Nenzi 2004, 306). 
Despite this ruling, the fishermen and other local entrepreneurs continued to target pilgrims, and over the decades tensions between them and the temple persisted. However, by the nineteenth century the number of pilgrims grew to the point that the temple infrastructure could not handle their accommodation, and here Nenzi observes the temple's efforts of commercialism as they offered various accommodations packages and special amenities, and provided elaborate meals and entertainment to guests. Nenzi argues that the attractions that drew pilgrims to this area developed into a commodification of local history and regional specialties, revealing a new common type of pilgrim that Nenzi calls the "consumer tourist" (ibid 286). "As commercialism burgeoned and the historical icons of the past became the trinkets and menu items of the present, the modalities of the interaction between visitors and sites also expanded dramatically, taking on new nuances that did not replace but complemented the old ones" (Nenzi 2008, 154). 

A similar trend of competition for the profits from pilgrims can also be observed in the region around Ōyama, where in the latter part of the eighteenth-century quarrels arose over packhorse fares and lodgings of pilgrims (ibid 308). By 1840 local inn and village leaders made an agreement to resolve the issues of lost profit from pilgrims by lowering ferry fares and elimination of regional tolls, which had been causing travelers to choose alternate routes. "These official ordinances and self-imposed codes of conduct intended to regulate the proliferation of traffic indicate the growing complexity of the space of travel and the increasing weight of consumer logic" (ibid 309). The importance of this consumer logic surrounding pilgrimage is also noticed by other historians, as Ambros (2008) argues that the religious institutions of Ōyama had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and travel related services (ibid, ??). As these providers of services and goods catered to the growing desires of pilgrims which fueled the regional economy and over time these regions came to rely on Ōyama pilgrimage. 

In other areas of Japan, religious institutions worked with the local region to promote pilgrimage. Thal's research (2005) into the Konpira religious site in Northern Shikoku, a destination which rivaled Ise in popularity, shows that the growth of this site was not due to its religious significance alone, but relied on business owners as much as it did on the priests. Thal argues that the popularity of this location developed in tandem with the surrounding markets and entertainment. In order to raise income as well as the religious status of the shrine,"[t]he priests of Konpira, like priests of other would be pilgrimage sites, simultaneously developed the attractions of both the god and the town to boost the economic viability of the sacred domain" (ibid, 3), holding lavish festivals and parades which they times with events in the nearby town. "In the phenomenon common to pilgrimage sites in Japan and around the world, Mt. Zozu and its gods grew amid a bustling pilgrimage economy of entertainments and commerce: performances, prostitution, and gambling proved as integral to the growth of the sites as amulets and worship" (ibid, 3). The support of Konpira also offered social benefits which "legitimized, protected, and enhanced the prestige" of the regional lords in exchange for their patronage. Thal describes how the support of three nearby daimyo, mutually benefited all parties, "weaving the sacred domain of Konpira - oustide the formal boundaries of any of the three larger domains - into an expanding network of personal, economic, and ritual relationships" (ibid, 78). The religious popularity of the Konpira site, which was fueled by the pilgrims who traveled to it, was of importance to these daimyo.

"The development of a widespread pilgrimage culture in the nineteenth century both relied upon and enabled the growth of economic networks of consumption, advertising, and offerings [...] The growth of such networks thus contributed to the development of an economy, a society, and ultimately a multifaceted culture in which the gods play an integral part" (Thal 2005, 98. 

This point is argued by Seaton et al argue, "[c]atering to pilgrims by providing food, lodging, and entertainment at religious sites was the foundation of much of the modern Japanese tourism industry" (2017, 20). 



%%"As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).%%

#### Section conclusion (Ishimori)

These examples demonstrates how important the economic potential of pilgrimage came to be for both the regional business as well as its shrines and temples during in the Edo period. It even affected the regional landscape, with new towns forming around popular shrines and temples (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">monzenmachi</mark>), and existing towns flourishing, both due to the direct results of pilgrimage (Ishimori 2009). The economic significance of pilgrimage would not have been dismissed by the bakufu or regional daimyo just because the peasant was someone who should stay tied to their land. 

In the media that helped to popularize that tourism (Fabricand-Person 2011), the authorities show no negative reaction, allowing maps to be used freely (REF) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RESEARCH</mark>

#### intro to next section 
While the above cases of conflict over competition of pilgrims reveals a neutral action of the authorities towards pilgrimage, it shows their priority of keeping order and responding to the needs of the community. However, in order to asses their disposition towards pilgrimage more definitively, it is necessary to review other cases of their involvement with pilgrimage where they show positive and negative reactions. 

### Authorities Response to Pilgrimage
The idea that authorities were for or against pilgrimage starts with the issue of translation. In Japan there is not just one word for "pilgrimage" but over ? that denote the purpose or way in which the travel was undertaken. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REFERENCE</mark>
It is therefore critical to look at which type of pilgrimage the bakufu tolerated and for what reason. This point is underscored in Ambros research (2008).
##### Ōyama Cult (Ambros)
#Ambros_2008
In Ambros's research (2008) of the Ōyama pilgrimage, she argues that the reaction of the bakufu toward pilgrimage depended on how exactly that pilgrimage was conducted. In looking at the make-up of Ōyama pilgrims, for example, she observes that they were largely from confraternities, where the members "pooled their funds to finance the pilgrimage, and therefore the pilgrims were not a burden on communities along the route but fueled the regional economy" (ibid, 16). The pilgrimages also usually took place before harvest, sending only a select few members of the community and thus village life was not disrupted. In addition, these pilgrimages were not for the sake of a single individual, but undertaken on behalf of the entire community, as the pilgrims would bring back amulets for everyone. These community-building aspects pilgrimage reinforced social harmony, therefore, the bakufu were not against it. "The few regulations that pertained to it were not so much meant to limit the pilgrimage to Ōyama but more to ensure that pilgrims did not extend their pilgrimages unduly and maintained order on their journeys" (ibid, 173). 

In contrast to the bakufu's support of Ōyama pilgrimages, Ambros points out that they outlawed confraternities of Mt. Fuji a number of times during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But the reasons behind their actions have been argued be because of how the Fuji cult was managed and how its members acted. As Tyler (1981) explains, this was a new religion without any connection to an established sect and therefore illegal by definition. In addition, the cult had troublesome practices, such as were frequently refusing to provide sick pilgrims with any other medication besides the holy water from Fuji, and chanting while handing out talismans outside people's gates. Finally, because the devotees were a mingling of commoners and samurai, the bakufu were concerned with potential subversion. In other words, it was not because the bakufu sought to curb tourism, but because this specific sect was seen as problematic for the region and socially disruptive. 

##### Nukemairi (Ambros, Vaporis)
Another type of pilgrimage that was seen as problematic was the *nukemairi*, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DEFINITION</mark>. This type of unauthorized pilgrimage was one that garnered opposition from the pilgrim's communities as well as the authorities. It was seen as selfish and an inconvenience to one's family and master. The Osaka City Magistrate thus prohibited *nukemairi* because it was threat to civil peace. Pilgrims were "without discretion, simply dropping what they were doing and leaving home, neglecting to shut doors or put out fires" (Vaporis 1994, 207). There were also instances where *nukemairi* pilgrims left infants and elderly unattended, and a case of too many apprentices suddenly leaving and causing a labor shortage. The authorities, therefore, deemed *nukemairi* to be causing harm to the region and its economy and thus discouraged it, and is often referenced in historians comments about the authorities' strictness of pilgrimage (REFERENCE).
However there are clearly community concerns surrounding *nukemairi* pilgrims, therefore being against it is not the same as being against pilgrimage and travel in general. One attempt Vaporis observes in looking at the large spectrum of regulations instituted by the bakufu is how they try to make applying for a permit easier in order to counter *nukemairi*. Therefore I would argue that the reasons behind this is to limit the negative regional repercussions. Even so, Ambros argues that this type of pilgrim is "partially responsible for the pervasive view of pilgrimage in the early modern period as a disorganized and even subversive activity" (2008, 145). 


The changes by Kaga and domains as well seem reactionary as they made the permit application process for more simple. He observes that "[t]his was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them" ( #Vaporis_1994, 173). 
##### Tolerance in Shikoku (Kouame)
#Kouamé_1997
Another part responsible for the negative view of pilgrimage is the "solitary, mendicant pilgrims"(Ambros 2008, 145) who traveled around the Shikoku circuit pilgrimage of eighty-eight religious sites, a journey that often took a period of months. This pilgrimage was often undertaken by individuals or small groups who were not connected to religious associations or confraternities, unlike pilgrimages of Ise and Oyama who had religious institutions promoting and managing the pilgrim's travel directly. Ambros argues that this mendicancy was view by both bafuku and domainal authorities as disruptive and antisocial because they "perceived religious travel as a burden on the communities that hosted pilgrims as well as on the home communities left behind" (Ambros 2008, 146). The bakufu therefore instituted constraints to counter that burden, such as travel duration and route which must be taken. While these constrains are often referenced as cases where the authorities were more restrictive towards pilgrims (Vaporis 1994), it is important to realize that they were instituted in order to protect the region. 

This type of pilgrimage has been argued by Blacker to used as a way of escaping the restrictiveness of Edo society: by cutting their moral ties and putting themselves outside vertical hierarchy, they gain the freedom much like the outcasts and divine wanderers. Traganou also argues that this liberation from social responsibilities and hierarchy that attracted pilgrims was seen by the bakufu as subversive and therefore posed a threat to the authority (Traganou 2004, REF).

%%Blacker : "Carmen Blacker, for example, argues that the archetypal pilgrim is the mendicant ( yugyōsha), a wandering ascetic, who often appeared in art and literature throughout Japanese history. Blacker holds that temporary pilgrims who absconded to the Ise Shrines or traveled along the long circuit in Shikoku emulated the ideal of the solitary mendicant and turned to pilgrimage as a means of escape from the confines of the ordinary world, forsaking their community for an individualistic spiritual journey. During the early modern period, such mendicancy was regarded as antisocial and disruptive by bakufu and domainal authorities." Ambros  %%
###### Support service for pilgrims
In addition, when looking at the level of freedom that the authorities were granting pilgrims, Kouamé (1997) argues that the restrictiveness of the regulations were comparatively insignificant. Amidst the many rules of the Shikoku pilgrimage was clear tolerance in an attempt to support a positive pilgrimage industry. Kouamé (1997) points out that while the authorities did try to closely regulate pilgrims and forbid the disorderly and disruptive elements of the pilgrimage, they also provided a system of support for those in need who followed the regulations"(ibid, 424). 

For example, in the case of a pilgrim's illness or death, they could depend on local officials to provide <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medical care</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">repatriation to their home town</mark>, or organize their <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">burial</mark>. 行き倒れ遍路
Looking at how many pilgrims the authorities helped return to their home regions was "quite significant", Kouamé argues, and "[i]t is clear that such assistance was standard practice" (ibid, 423). It is also important to note that these regulations were %%may have been the Shikoku authorities just following the rules%% laid down by the Tokugawa bakufu in the seventeenth century. %%This support for pilgrims were ordinances that was enacted in the late seventeenth century by the bakufu.%% ( MURAKAMI 1995, pp. 2–4) (kouame 423).  The Shikoku local authorities should not be analyzed in terms of only oppressive control, because it is clear that they also helped pilgrims in trouble. (ibid, 421). 

There were, of course, punishment for violates of rules, such as denying the pilgrims entrance to a province. In one such instance in the early 1800s, two sick pilgrims who were undertaking the Shikoku pilgrims in hopes of it curing their illness were denied entry into Tosa, the southern region of Shikoku were the authorities are believed to have been the most severe towards pilgrims. In looking at the situation of the region at this time however, Kouamé observes that Tosa was experiencing a famine, and thus the authorities were likely trying to prevent the sick pilgrims, who they feared might stay in the province beyond their allotted time, from becoming a burden to the locals (ibid, 418). This example demonstrates that the background of the situation surrounding actions taken against pilgrims needs careful consideration, because the caution exercised by the Tosa authorities may be not a reflection of their position against pilgrimage, but against specific cases of negative regional repercussions or antisocial elements. 

However, Kouamé argues that even in such cases where those antisocial elements existed, it appears "to have had no influence on the general attitudes of local authorities towards common pilgrims" (1997, 419). In all the historical materials of the dysfunctional aspects of the Shikoku pilgrimage, Kouamé advices caution. "To infer from them that pilgrims of this sort were numerous and dangerous to the social order could well be erroneous" (ibid, 420), because while a bureaucracy's does not note the cases where everything is in order. Kouamé concludes that the response to the Shikoku pilgrimage "reveals that the political authorities of the latter Tokugawa period were tolerant regarding the mobility of the ordinary populace" (ibid, 143). The strictness of the Shikoku authorities can be arguably their response to a particularly problematic  pilgrimage. 

#### Section conclusion 
While some historians may point to the Shikoku pilgrimage as an example of the bakufu's opposition of pilgrimage (REF), upon closer examination it provides evidence of bakufu's support of the pilgrims during their journey. As the cases above reveal, the bakufu was clearly not against all pilgrimage; how the pilgrimage was conducted and how it affected the local region appears to be a deciding factor on whether the authorities supported or prohibited it. Furthermore, from their reaction it is evident that they prioritized keeping the economic effects of the pilgrimage industry positive. 
This focus of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity is also reflected in how the authorities restructured and managed the rice tax, as argued in Hall (2022). #Hall_2022
%%n the rice tax, the fact that the authorities left the peasants with a surplus reflects their priority of managing the economy and promoting regional prosperity. %%
The bakufu was focused on keeping a balanced rice market and growing yields, and to that end they intentionally left a surplus of rice with the peasants. This reveals their underlying economic motivations and how they governed with a degree of benevolence. Like their actions regarding the rice tax, if the pilgrimage of the peasants had a positive economic impact, and as long as that travel did not hinder the crop yields, both the bakufu and regional daimyo would be inclined to allow it, making rules to keep in within the confines that prevented economic harm to the region. Such a position would seem more beneficial than to spend more effort and money into micromanaging the lower class. Indeed, the majority of peasants traveled in their free time after their farmer's responsibilities were fulfilled (REF). The constraints instituted toward pilgrimage were an attempt to make the system more suitable in response to the needs of the people, instead of trying to control what the people needed. Vaporis mentions these observations,  notices the regulations dealing with pilgrimage have to do with negative economic effects, he fails to comment on the positive economic effects that travelers brought. 

The above research, while demonstrating an acceptance of pilgrimage and the priority of economic prosperity, the question of why still remains. To understand the reason behind the bakufu's actions it is necessary to look at the beginning of the Tokugawa period when the society changes unfolded. 

I argue that their reaction is a reflection of the changing style of governance of the Tokugawa bakufu, which the daimyo largely followed. 


### Tokugawa's governance (Hall, Paramore, Roberts)
%%The image of Tokugawa bakufu is often portrayed as authoritarian, with "squeezing of the peasants" and limiting all their freedom (REF), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. %%
The shift to prioritizing the economic prosperity of the common people is a result of the change of governance and social structure of the bakufu and daimyo. 


This focus on ensuring the prosperity of the common people reflects the changing governance structure of the bakufu and reflected in common styles of daimyo structure, what has been described by some historians as "benevolence" (REF). While #Gordon_2003 and #Tanimoto_2019  argue that the Confucian concept of benevolence was not popular in the seventeenth century, pointing out the authoritarian "squeezing of the peasants" for their own benefit, Tanimoto does at admit that there are some instances, such as civil engineering infrastructure, the economic interests of the authorities and the common people likely overlapped. 
My argument goes beyond that to argue that there was a trend in the governance of both the bakufu and the daimyo toward this benevolence rule, or liberalistic rule (REF). 

##### Bizen Daimyo (Hall)
 #Hall_1966
In the late seventeenth century as Tokugawa Ieyasu rose to power, he made many attempts to legitimize his position as shogun, including connecting his lineage to the imperial family and Minamoto line. Despite these efforts, however, he still remained politically precarious. To make up for this, he strengthened his economic power (which came largely from his landholdings), ensured the daimyo were also put into a precarious position, and drew upon Confucian ethics by using the claim of benevolent governance as justification for the Tokugawa regime (Hall 1966).
To build his economic power, Tokugawa put in his direct control the most productive lands and commercial centers, which meant that he had control of monetary and commercial policy, and access to the largest supplies of loan capital. In addition, he also owned the largest mines of precious metals which helped his ability to control currency. While Tokugawa's manpower may  have been spread thin across all of Japan, as "long as the economic and technological level of the country remained relatively unchanged, the Tokugawa [administration] could thus claim certain economic advantages which made possible their domination of national economic policy and the nationwide organs of exchange and transportation" (ibid, 358-359). 
In order to immobilize potential opposition of the daimyo to the Tokugawa regime, the daimyo were relocated and restructured, and the tenure of their family became no longer always hereditary. The bakufu conducted regular inspections of the daimyo, checking the domain's productivity, administration methods, financial resources, and the people's standards of living. The confiscation of a daimyo's lands or transfer to a different region, which happened frequently, were usually "for lack of heir, mismanagement, infringement of the basic regulations of the shogunate, or, of course, as a sign of favor" (ibid 362). In addition, the samurai were taken from the villages and put to live in the castle towns, which greatly weakened the daimyo's direct connection to the villages. As a consequence of these changes, "the peasantry and other classes as well came to acquire a more uniform public identity ",  and the position of the daimyo shifted from "manorial lords or patriarchal superiors" to "rulers and officials" (ibid, 392). Hall argues that "Tokugawa government rested on the fundamental conception that society was composed of statuses, or estates, each with its particular function" (ibid, 369). 
However, this new approach to social organization created the need to devise a more rational basis and ideological foundation of one's rule. Thus the Tokugawa shoguns (and following their example the daimyo) drew upon the concepts from Confucianism, using its ethical values and principles of social structure in an attempt to justify their status-based legislation. The changes that the Tokugawa regime instituted in order to protect his hegemony, Hall argues, fundamentally transformed the "whole structure of society and the exercise of authority"; the relationships of society that had been "essentially vertical systems were being replaced by more generalized, horizontally defined, functional group relationships" (392-393). 
These changes moved the focus to whether the ruler was fit to manage the subjects of the realm, as Hall points out that "the successful daimyo after 1600 was one who learned to master the ethical-rational system of beliefs which supported his right to rule as a benevolent autocrat committed to the welfare of his subjects" (ibid, 393).




%%**Mitsumasa example**
As an example of this type of benevolent rule, Hall presents the Mitsumasa daimyo of the Bizen province, observing that the government was concerned with the well-being of the lower class. He argues that the style of government of the Bizen province, which lasted for two hundred years, provides "one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age" (ibid, 403). 
Hall describes the principles of Mitsumasa's governance as being based on Confucian principles of benevolent authoritarianism. 

  "Mitsumasa built upon the foundations of military organization and civil administration which had been laid by his predecessors, filling out the body of codified injunctions and bureaucratic precedents. But he went further and added to his rule the indispensable ingredient of moral rationale" (ibid, 403).
Mitsumasa's fame was due to how adapted the Confucian ethical ideas to his governance and "persistently sought to regulate his own conduct by them".
%%

"Throughout the Tokugawa period it was the existence of real power together with the symbols which combined to support the shogun in his position as hegemon" (Hall 1966, 353). 

In other words, the power of the Tokugawa bakufu was closely connected to the economic potential they held 

This is the reason behind the bakuf's focus on the economy, and why they closely managed the rice market as revealed in Hall (2022).

The precarious position of both the bakufu and the daimyo led to their using the Confucsian value of benevolent ruler in order to validate their position, and their focusing on their economic power in lieu of military power. 

##### Bakufu governance changes (Paramore)
As time went on, the changes in governance shifted even more toward a socially responsive governmental stance, as seen in Paramore's research (2012) on the state academy and its examination system in the later half of the Tokugawa period.
%%More specific example of that government's political stance can be seen in Paramore's research ( #Paramore_2012 2012) on changes in governance that occurred during the later half of Tokugawa period.%% Refuting the arguments that Neo-Confucian political concepts encouraged authoritarianism, Paramore argues that governmental changes were usually designed to open up the decision making process to more people, and can be seen as "an attempt to generate more socially engaged, inclusive, and responsive governance" (ibid, 27). This argument against the idea that the Tokugawa government was top-down and authoritarian.
While Paramore's research looks at the later half of the Tokugawa period, there are examples of bottom-up governance from the seventeenth century, observed by Roberts (1998) research on mercantilism in the Edo period. 

Nakai's research

##### Tosa Daimyo (Roberts)
#Roberts_1998


Roberts argues that the concept behind merchants and others engaged in commerce was the rhetoric of *kokueki*, which means "prosperity of the country".  
In his research on the roots of economic nationalism in Japan, he argued that in the 1700's, a the mercantilist thought developed that was centered on the *kokueki*, influenced the daimyo as they sought to reduce the the dominance of the economy of the Tokugawa shogunate. Observing how merchant thought found its way into domainal governance, Roberts describes how 

"Petitioning, through regular channels to middle-level officials and through the more special petition box that sent opinions directly to the lord, was a device to integrate opinions of those outside of the government hierarchy into the decision-making process of the rulers"
These were used by many of the domains, including Edo bakufu.

%%"Commoners led the response "with a mercantilist strategy of protection and development of the commercial economy. They resisted the economy of service by creating a new economic rhetoric that decentered the lord, imagined the domain as an economic country, and gave merchants a public worth and identity unknown in Confucian economic thought. This thought and activity changed domainal government, and played an important role in the decline of shogunal authority, producing proto-nationalist practices and rhetoric that influenced Meiji era national development" %%

In Roberts' research (1998) of the merchant thought during the Edo period, he observes that one way the government incorporated new ideas and policies into their administration was the use of petition boxes. "Petitioning in all forms was a major means of integrating the interests of the ruled and the rulers" (ibid, 132). Roberts believes that this prevalence of petitioning suggests a search for new ideas, 

and over time the mercantilist thought of *kokueki*, meaning "prosperity of the country", became embedded into the discourse of the samurai through petitions, and ultimately the samurai adopted the *kokueki* thought into their discourse (ibid, 133). 
Among petitions where the term *kokueki* appears are calls for the encouraging tourism, where a scabbard maker Zenpachi suggests, among other things, that the daimyo promote pilgrimage to a famous local temple. Zenpachi argues that if access into the region was made easier and "pilgrims increased, 'every year great amounts of foreign gold and silver would drop into the country, working eternally for the prosperity of the country and providing all of the people with a living'" (ibid, 142)."
Roberts points out an important part of this petition is that in Zenpachi's many suggestions, none of them represent his personal economic interest and was "a way of understanding the economy and the lord's and people's roles within it. This was inspired, Roberts argues, by the idea of *kokueki*. 

   "It is not inevitable that a scabbard maker should be so concerned with, as he says, 'thinking of ways in which to have foreign money drop into Tosa' [...] What was common to these and many other petitions was a vision of Tosa as a single economic unit, the welfare of which was dependent mainly upon commercial concerns - most often export industries - and cash flow within the domain" (ibid, 142).
   
While Roberts observes that not all petitions were enacted, and often that was disagreement among townspeople on what should be suggested, and the "samurai interest in the economic potential of commerce and commercially inspired industry was mixed" (ibid ,149).
I would argue that they reflect how widespread mercantile thought was becoming in Edo period Japan, and how the interests of the lower classes could reached the rulers. 


## Conclusion (450-800 words)
Sum up the reasons for tourism and how they outweigh against tourism. If the authorities were more concerned about economy and managing the country, it is understandable why they would not hinder pilgrimage and only lightly voice "unnecessary travel".


Following this, an examination of **how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry.** Using studies that look closely at the development of pilgrimage reveals that the economic potential of these travelers was realized by the shrine and temples Oshi, who promoted and organized pilgrim's travel and organize travel for pilgrims (Kanzaki 1995). Their efforts resulted in the direct increase of pilgrims (Ambros 2008) and over time other local entities began to vie for the service of those travelers, creating a competitive market. This research emphasizes just how vital the tourism industry that emerged from pilgrimage came to be for many regions of Japan.
 
Next, an analysis of **how authorities respond to this industry** reveals that in many cases where communities take steps to allow and support pilgrimage travel they are met with positive responses from authorities (Ambros 2008, Kouamé 1997,  Thal 2005). In cases where the authorities attempt to restrict pilgrimage (Vaporis ?), the main factor in the authorities' actions appears to be for the purpose of limiting the negative economic effect of pilgrimage that it had towards the surrounding region. I argue that in both of these cases reflect the authorities' concern with the economy; therefore they limit pilgrimage when it has negative affect on region and allowing it when the effect is positive or neutral. 


Finally, I argue that the reason the **Tokugawa authorities were primarily concerned with the economy was due to their style of governance** that realized the overall benefit in ensuring prosperity of the lower class. This can be traced back to the beginning of Edo period when they restructured the rice tax and prioritized agricultural development, even at the sake of improving the quality of life for the commoners. 
research of Tokugawa bakufu and daimyo governance reveals a trend of 
using Confucian ideals of benevolent rule and economic prosperity of the people in order to legitimize their position.

moving away from authoritarian methods and prioritizing the welfare of the people. As the entire tax system was based on the efforts of the farmer, this would result in their own prosperity.

To support this argument I present research that reveals the bottom-up style of governance that looks more democratic than authoritarian (Paramore 2012), and research that shows benevolent ruling was becoming more common and linked to a region's prosperity (Hall 1966). While this research might argue that the basis for this style of governance was largely based in Confucianism, another possibility is that it simply was more economically rewarding for the rulers. As my previous research on the rice tax revealed, the bakufu saw it in their own wellbeing to benevolently leave the peasants with a surplus, because it led to an overall increase in rice tax and an increase in other commodities. %%I believe this to represent their overall priority and interest in the economy.%%

From the findings of this research, I argue that the economic potential of pilgrimage, which was exploited by the religiously affiliated oshi, popularized by media and enhanced by the competition of regional businesses, was also understood by the bakufu a became a determining factor in how they, and subsequently the regional authorities, responded to pilgrimage. The tourism industry intertwined in/of pilgrimage was greatly important to the regions and therefore would also be important to the rulers, as it was in their best interest to ensure the region's economic prosperity.

"The early modern system was not unremittingly oppressive but gave many institutions opportunities to operate on their own terms by harnessing local and regional resources" (Ambros 2008, 239).

Kouamé "the case of Shikoku could provide an example of the degree of tolerance seen in an administration renowned for its severity and the degree of flexibility of a social system known for its rigidity" (ibid, 414). 

### Dichotomy of Pleasure & Religion a modern idea 
Finally, in addition to the bakufu's focus on economy and not micromanaging commoner's lives, another reason why pilgrimage was allowed to the extent it was is because pilgrimage for religious reasons and pleasure was intertwined in the Edo period. 
Our idea that pilgrims used pilgrimage as a pretense (or *tatemae*) under which they hid their real intent of pleasure travel (*honne*) is not an excuse to get around the bakufu's rules, as X has argued. Rather, it represents the fact that the pilgrimage consisted of both enjoyable sightseeing and religious worship, the separation of which is a modern phenomenon, as argued by Oshino. "The accounts seem to me to illustrate the inextricable conjoining of faith and pleasure that constituted the essence of the phenomenon of pilgrimage" (Oshino 2002, 469). 
"The modern dualistic ethic, with its positing of an opposition between the sacred and the profane, did not exist in that context. This was true also of travel" (ibid). 
To make an argument that the bakufu were fine with religious pilgrimage and not l

"There remains little debate about whether the sacred and profane blended in the act of pilgrimage" (Goree 2020, 19).


### Why this research is meaningful	

It reveals not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, but also the shows the underlying motivations behind the bakufu and ruling authorities' actions and how they dealt with the lower classes. 
This research is important not just in understanding the motivations of the authorities, but emphasizes the economic value of pilgrimage as essential to understanding why travel became so prevalent among the Edo populace. 

%%These points are both vital to understanding what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan. %%
