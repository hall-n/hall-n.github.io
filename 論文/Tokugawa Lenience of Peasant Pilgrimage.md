Increase in tourism. Many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and travel, implementing a system of barriers to impede their movement, barriers which the peasants found ways to circumvent. Other research into travel and the permit system, however, reveals that both the daimyo and bakufu were clearly tolerant towards allowing peasants to travel, showing hesitance to enforce the laws that controlled peasants mobility. 
%% the bakufu was reluctant to enforce travel limitations on peasants.%% 
%%the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it%%
I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the %%commercialization of travel  economic motivations behind travel promotion which gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a%% misunderstanding of the position of the authorities towards peasants; the bakufu and daimyo's position was not authoritarian, but was focused on keeping their region prosperous; therefore, as long as travel did not negatively effect the peasant's production, they had little reason to ban its practice. Using recent research that reveals cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that the economic benefits of pilgrimage would encourage authorities to allow it's practice. This explanation of the authorities' economic objective explains why they took steps to keep travel within reason, seeking to eliminate *nukemairi* pilgrimages which had a negative effect on the regions while making permits for ?? more easily obtainable.  
%%the economic motivations that lie behind both the travel agent like oshi who encouraged peasants to travel and the%%
%%combined with the bakufu's position of being a "benevolent'" ruler gave them less incentive to stop the peasants from traveling than it did to simply manage the system to keep up with the sudden surge of pilgrimage travel.%%

## Key Phrases
- bakufu implemented a system of travel regulations and barriers to control the mobility of commoners
- reluctance of the bakufu to enforce its travel laws
- commoners, however, found ways to circumvent these barriers, frequently ignoring the laws designed to control their mobility.

## Introduction

During the Edo period, a daunting amount of Japanese took to the roads to travel on pilgrimages. While the purpose was visiting temples and shrines, over time other sightseeing and tourism motivations emerged. Despite the popularity of travel, many historians have argued that that the ruling authorities were negatively positioned against peasant pilgrimage, claiming that the bakufu envisioned peasant's being tied to the land ( #Vaporis). Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF). However, this reasoning alone does not explain why were the permits that were necessary for travel able to obtained so easily by commoners as time went by. Nor does it explain why the checkpoint officials show more laxity to the peasants as time went on. If were are to assume that the bakufu and daimyo authorities were positioned against travel, then their lenience of it appears contradictory. This paper searches for the reason behind that lenience.
In order to understand the authorities' motivations, I believe it is necessary to examine the situation surrounding pilgrimage itself. In recent years, historians have approached the topic from many different angles asking new questions about how and why pilgrimage became so widely practiced. Their research reveals the economic motivations underlying the promotion of pilgrimage by the *oshi*, who operated much like a travel agent to attract pilgrims to the temple or shrine they were affiliated to. As pilgrimage increased, other parties arose to take advantage of this tourism. Services and business arose to cater to this traveler and over time some regions' economy came to rely on pilgrims. I believe this to be an example of the positive economic benefit that pilgrimage offered regions. I argue that these economic benefits to be gained from pilgrimage is one reason why the authorities were lenient towards it. 
In addition, I argue this is because their purpose was not authoritarian, but to 
%%Studies of uncover the situation of pilgrimage; shikoku, Oyama. %%
These studies reveal the widespread effects of pilgrimage and the responses from authorities and communities. I argue that the social and economic effects of pilgrimage, which slowly became a form of ? tourism is highly relevant to understand the position of the bakufu and daimyo. 


Research that covers the Tokugawa road barriers the travel permit system in great detail is the work of Vaporis Constantine.  he challenges the idea that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, and argues that the peasants found ways to circumvent the barriers. 
%%Overall the image he presents is the authorities being against travel, and the peasants trying to defy%%
He outlines the numerous examples of authorities being negatively positioned against peasant pilgrimage and instances where it was banned.
His main argument is that the peasants were mobile, despite the efforts of the authorities to make them otherwise. 

Vaporis's study of travel during the Tokugawa period, they argue against accepting a "legalistic interpretation of Tokugawa Japan" (6), as doing so %%overlooks crucial factors %% 
overestimates the state's authority and incorrectly represents peasants as "immobile", with their movements severely restricted and strictly inspected at barriers.  
%%The evidence presented here will demonstrate that, while sekisho did affect the flow and pattern of travel throughout Tokugawa Japan, %% His conclusion is that despite the intention of the authorities, the *sekisho* barriers did not significantly impede peasant travelers (ibid, 7) though he does not put forward the question of why. 

Based on this research, this paper will examine previous evidence used in determine the position of the authorities
What reasons they could have to be for or against pilgrimage, and with that position in mind, consider the economic effects of pilgrimage. 

#### Outline
**Background:** Brief explanation of rise of pilgrimage and its change to sightseeing and tourism.

This rise is a result increased **ability** and **motivation** to undertake pilgrimage which grew significantly over the course of the Edo period.  Recent research has revealed much about the motivations that spurred peasant travel, 
The safety and convenience that the highway offered allowed travel to be undertaken by not just the elite, but the the commoner; that is, as long as they could obtain a permit to pass through the *sekisho* barriers that the bakufu positioned along the highway. 


It is here that a contradiction arises; if the authorities were set against peasant travel and idealized a society where the peasants remained tied to the land ( #Vaporis_1994 **why their laxity** towards it? 


the peasants' movements was at the same time highlighting their tolerance of travel and flexibility of the system. However, the question that Vaporis does not ask is why the authorities were so lax in allowing pilgrimage, despite what he argues as clear motivations against it #Nosco_1996 .

That laxity is arguably the largest factor in the peasant's ability to travel, as without the ability to obtain a permit and  
would have severely hindered all movements o
yet the reason behind it remains obscure.


**Answer:** While social acceptance of pilgrimage could have been influential,  I argue that the reason for the authorities laxity towards peasant pilgrimage was the bakufu's economic focus and position toward the peasants of benevolent ruler. Because they were more focused on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">keeping a propserous country rather than lording over the lower class</mark> ,  the the economic factors surrounding pilgrimage 
that are the primary reason which  affected the their desire and ability to restrict the movements of the lower class. Specifically, the rise of pilgrimage tourism as an industry and the economic benefits thereof. 
Therefore, I argue that the reason for this laxity lies in:
- **economic motivations to encourage pilgrimage**
	As seen in motivations to promote tourism by the oshi, there were a number of economic benefits of pilgrimage that were desired not just by the shrines and temples. As 
	Evidence: 
	- cases where they limit pilgrimage are for their negative affects on region. They never seek to stop pilgrimage itself.
- **position of benevolent ruler** and being more concerned with economy than domineering commoner's lives. 
	Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up ( #Paramore_2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" ( #Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule ( #Cambridge, #Hall_1966 ). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" ( #Vaporis 1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.
**Conclusion:** Sum up the reasons for tourism and how they outweigh against tourism. If the authorities were more concerned about economy and managing the country, it is understandable why they would not hinder pilgrimage and only lightly voice "unnecessary travel".
**Why this research is meaningful:** This research will reveal not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, but also the shows the underlying motivations behind the bakufu and ruling authorities' actions and how they dealt with the lower class. These points are both vital to understanding  what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan. 

To understand this economic element, it is first necessary to understand the situation surrounding pilgrimage. Therefore I will briefly outline the rise in pilgrimage the primary factors that led to its increase. 

## Background: The rise of tourism pilgrimage
As Japan entered an era of peace in the beginning of the Tokugawa period, many changes were instituted that would allow for mass travel.  While travel was still time consuming and arduous, it was no longer dangerous. With the alternate attendance system, the amount of people traveling the roads grew significantly, thus the bakufu made keeping the traffic flowing smoothly a high priority. 
They created a centralized road network, and while it spanned across the country through many region's territories, the bakufu abolished private barriers and tolls. Along the highway, trees were planted for shade and wind cover, and wheels that would damage the road surface became banned. Only travel by foot or by **horse** was allowed, and therefore  did not **eliminate commoner from using it.** In order to facilitate travel, **road stations and corvee labor was instituted**, and while they had to prioritize servicing **Tokugawa officials and daimyo,** they could cater to peasants and the wider population. Thus, the travel changes that were made **in order for the daimyo and their alternate attendance** could be taken advantage of by the commoner, provided they had a valid permit to pass through the *sekisho*, or X barriers that the bakufu set up along the highway. While travel for pleasure was not recognized at that time (?), pilgrimage and visits to onsen for health reasons were permitted. 

Looking at the amount of travelers that took to the roads, it is clear that peasant pilgrimage greatly increased over the course of the Edo period. Over time it  became more complex than just shrine and temple visits, slowly turned into a tourism industry, with sightseeing and enjoying local specialties becoming commonplace and often turning into the primary focus of the pilgrimage itself (REF).  
When looking at tourism historically, Japan was early in commoner's being able to travel, especially when compared to European countries, where it was largely limited to nobility (REF). 
As historians have researched exactly how and why these changes came about, they have uncovered various economic and religious factors, which I believe can be organized into two overall categories;  motivation and ability. 
### Motivation
Travel in the Edo period was mostly done by foot and on average one could cover **40 kilometers in a day**. Depending on the destination, the trip could take weeks or even months to complete, costing both time, effort and money. 
%%Thus it has been argued that there had to have been ample motivation to set out on such a journey (REF). 
%%
As motivation for undertaking such a journey, research has revealed primary two main factors; the popular image of pilgrimage held by society and its direct promotion by those affiliated with shrines and temples. 
#### Popular image of pilgrimage
the image of pilgrimage gained from popular media.
A positive travel image with connotations of religious image of a sacred wanderer and seen as a rite of passage (REF)
- sacred wanderer image (REF)
- freedom of Edo society restrictions ( #Blacker_1984 )	 and travel as escape ( #Traganou_2004)
- rite of passage by overcoming hardships of travel (REF)
- Literary works spread travel popularity 
	- #Fabricand-Person_2011 
#### Pilgrimage promotion 
Promotion of travel was largely due to the efforts of the *onshi* or *oshi*, 
who promoted temples and

They operated much like a travel agent . 
They were  affiliated with temples and shrines, and originally being ?? they began to take on the form of ?. 
They arranged the routes to popular religious destinations, offering accommodation 

Oshi, who are argued to be much like a travel agent 
arranging accommodation and providing travel information (REF)

In Ambros's research of the Oyama shrine in the Kanto area (2008), she argues that these oshi were the key players in growing the popularity of pilgrimage, and are responsible for transforming Oyama into a major tourist destination. 

The direct promotion of pilgrimage along with offering convenience of lodgings and travel information. oshi, by what would later be called the worlds first travel agents. 

"They were generally run by those connected to religious establishments, such as low level priests called onshi or oshi, who posted their subordinates and deputies around the country to act as tour guides. These priests contributed greatly to ･the institutionalization of package tours. .. These examples show that in Japan religious offcials had a role in institutionalizing the travel industry from before the Edo period" ( #Tadao_1995, 6).

While originally much like a missionary, over time they "became more merchants than priests, each with their own territory" ( #Kanzaki_1995, ?). 

"The same style of entertainment continued after the oshi became independent from the shrine and started to do business with ordinary people, in the Edo period, but underneath the hospitality lay a cunning business spirit. . What they intended was advertisement with maximum effect ( #Kanzaki_1995, 48)".

#### Commercialization of pilgrimage 
( #Ishimori_2009)
Pilgrimage led to contents tourism ( #SeatonEtal_2017)

### Ability
%%In research that reveals the peasant's ability to travel, historians have pointed to the countrywide road system and the permit system.%%
#### Travel infrastructure 
The road (REF) which<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> was kept well maintained and in Edo's time of peace could be travelled safely</mark>. While originally laid out by the bakufu for the alternate attendance system of the daimyo, it was able to be used by commoners as well. Inns and other services at checkpoints had to prioritize daimyo (REF), but they were still allowed to accommodate the lower class. 
#### The permit system
However, in order to pass through the many checkpoints along the highway, one needed to have a permit. Such a permit would not be issued for simply travel for pleasure, but a journey for the purpose of pilgrimage was permissible.  

- the permit system and how peasant's could obtain a pass in order to proceed through the many barrier checkpoints positioned around the country. 
%%Laxity of the permit system and checkpoints, despite shogunate wanting peasants to stay at their fields and refrain from travel (REF)%%

Perhaps the most detailed research on peasant's ability to travel has been conducted by Vaporis in his papers about the road conditions and many barriers, both physical and social. 
His main arguments that are relevant to this paper is that the authorities were against travel and wished for the peasants to remain at their farmland, and that despite that position, they were unable to limit the movements of the peasants who 


In line with many other historians, he has argued at length how the authorities were bent on preventing the peasant's ability to travel, detailing the negative effects from pilgrimage and how the authorities envisioned the peasants being tied to the land. As both the bakufu and daimyo's income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities.
However, in his detailed account of the permit system and how it changed over the years, Vaporis reveals that not only does the bakufu and checkpoint officials deal with the peasants who travel with a measure of laxity, over time that laxity increases and changes to the permit system do not obstruct peasant pilgrimage, only encourage permit taking. In other words, the position of officials, which historians' have argued to be against peasant travel, does not match the actions they have taken in response. While Vaporis' research presents a clear view of the situation that became more tolerant of peasant's pilgrimage, he fails to ask why this trend occurred. If the bakufu authorities had aspirations for control over the peasants to keep them tied to their lands, why do the changes to the permit system only make them more flexible and easily obtained? While this question remains unasked in Vaporis' many writings pertaining to travel, I believe the answer lies in the motivations that gave the commoners reasons to undertake pilgrimage. Looking at research from other historians, many have argued the negative perspective of authorities towards peasant travel, usually referencing Vaporis' work. However, in the last few decades as the social dynamics of the Edo period peasants has become a topic of interest,  the research of other historians has revealed cases of indifference and even positive perceptions of pilgrimage by authorities. 

This research on the motivations for travel will .


## Question: Why were authorities lax with peasant pilgrimage?

#### Argument by historians
In the many articles on travel in the Edo period there is an overall perception that the bakufu and daimyo held a position against pilgrimage, wishing to restrict unnecessary movement ( #Kanzaki_1995, #Vaporis_2012, #Watkins_2008), particularly of women and peasants ( #Nenzi_2004). While none openly ask the question of why, some do reference economic and social factors.
In Vaporis' many works on the travel permit system, he often mentions how the authorities idealized a society where the peasants "remained tied to the land" ( #Vaporis_1994, 136). Along with historian #Traganou_2004) who wrote at length on traveling the Tokaido Road, Vaporis explain this desire to keep farmers at their land is because travel might reduce agricultural production. Because both the bakufu and daimyo's finances are directly tied to the production of the lands farmed by the peasants, this would appear to be logical reaction. Moving behond economic reasons, #Traganou_2004) argues that the pilgrimage itself posed a threat to bakufu's authority, though does not specifically outline why and how.

#Blacker_1984 ) also argues that the peasants were hindered by "the increasingly harassing restrictions imposed by the han authorities on a custom which appeared in their eyes frivolous, useless, extravagant and immoral. By absenting themselves for several weeks to walk to Ise, the farmers neglected their proper duty and caused a fall in production" ( #Blacker_1984 , 604). Though Blacker does admit that some daimyo did not object when the travel was undertaken during the idle part of the year. 

Vaporis as well references hard evidence on what the authorities thought of the peasants undertaking pilgrimage. 


These statements are from only single individuals and therefore may not reflect the majority of opinions and overall stance of the bakufu. Taking the perspective of the historians above and assuming that the bakufu were against peasant pilgrimage, then why would they not have taken steps to restrict it? By examining the bakufu's possible motives might reveal their position towards travel.

At the same time, Vaporis describes the many cases of laxity where checkpoint officials allowed passage for peasants without permits or letting slide permit related offenses. What are we to make of this apparent paradox?

There are religious, economic, and social factors that surround the promotion of pilgrimage and its subsequent increase, yet the position of the authorities has been against pilgrimage in spite of those factors. 
%%but none of them would have been possible had the authorities not been so lax with letting pilgrims travel %%
Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain. 

I believe the primary factors in the authorities' lenience toward pilgrimage is the Tokugawa regime's socially responsive, bottum-up ( #Paramore_2012 ) governance and the economic impact of pilgrimage.  

benevolent ruler position held by the bakufu authorities, which the daimyo largely followed (REF). %%In order to understand these economic effects, To answer the question of why there was such laxity towards peasant pilgrimage, it is necessary to look at both its positive and negative effects and who stands to gain from its proliferation.%% 
### Tokugawa's governance
The image of Tokugawa bakufu is often portrayed as authoritarian, with "squeezing of the peasants" and limiting all their freedom (REF), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. 
#Gordon_2003 and #Tanimoto_2019  argue that while Confucian concept of benevolence was not popular in the seventeenth century, in some instances, such as civil engineering infrastructure, the economic interests of the authorities and the common people likely overlapped  #Tanimoto_2019 .
Examining bureaucratic governance, #Paramore_2012 argues that reforms to the Tokugawa state "were usually designed to open government structures to bottom-up input" (ibid, 25). He argues that the changes opened up the decision making process to more people, and can be seen as "an attempt to generate more socially engaged, inclusive, and responsive governance" (ibid, 27)

Position of authorities: benevolent ruler, desire to manage not domineer

- Policies in place, but actual implementation of them up to the person in charge. 
- Soft rules that can adapt to circumstances. 
#### Not authoritarian
#Paramore_2012 

The following examples reflects the bakufu and daimyo's position of 
#### Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies
#### Confucian precepts of benevolent rule
#Cambridge 
##### Bizen's example of a benevolent ruler
The administration of Bizen was typical of the kind which was provided by the larger daimyo of the Tokugawa period. ( #Hall_1966 410) 
That sees the prosperity of his entire realm and its citizens as a reflection
Hall argues that Mitsumasa of the Bizen province provides "one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age" (ibid, 403)
Hall also points out that "The Tokugawa bakufu had led the way in drawing upon the concepts of Confucianism and seeking ideological justification for its regime in the claims of benevolent government" (ibid, 403). 

Reflecting the degree to which the confucian benevolent ruler was a concept to authorities. While #Gordon_2003 and #Tanimoto_2019 both argue that the benevolence appears limited in how the bakufu deals with peasants, mentioning the often quoted "squeezing of the peasants. However, as I argued in Hall 2022, the fact that the authorities left the peasants with a surplus reflects their priority of economic growth. Perhaps what benevolence represents the idea that if the people are prosperous, those ruling them will also be part in this prosperity. 
This together with the Bizen example presents an image of realistic benevolence.  

#### Leaving peasants with surplus
In my previous research ( #Hall_2022), I argued that the position of the shogunate was focused on keeping a balanced rice market, and to that end they intentionally left a surplus of rice with the peasants. I believe this to be an example of their underlying economic motivations. Therefore, if the pilgrimage of the peasants had a positive economic impact, and as long as those peasants paid their rice tribute, they would be more inclined to allow it, making changing to keep in within the confines that prevented economic harm to the region (**as one historian mentions)** than to spend more effort and money into micromanaging. Indeed, the majority of peasants traveled in their free time after their farmer's responsibilities were fulfilled (REF). 

Indeed, Vaporis notices the regulations with 

### Negative effects of pilgrimage
Looking at the reasons the authorities might have to be against pilgrimage. 

Perhaps the most persuasive argument that would explain the authorities desire to restrict or ban pilgrimage is of an economic origin. Vaporis explains how travelling into other regions meant that money leaving the domain caused concern for the ruler. For example, when the Kaga domain restricted pilgrimage to a popular Kyoto shrine, they claimed it was to "stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver" ( #Vaporis_1994, 202).

"regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control" ( #Vaporis_1994, 198).

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. The changes by the Kaga and  domains as well seem reactionary as they made the permit application process for more simple. He observes that "[t]his was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them on nukemairi" ( #Vaporis_1994, 173). While making no comment on nukemairi has been argued to be damaging to the economy, allowing those people to acquire permits gives us the image that the underlying motivation was to urge people to follow the system, in other words, make the system more suitable in response to the needs of the people, instead of trying to control what the people needed. 


"Some of the ways domains sought to regulate pilgrimage were setting certain economic qualifications for the issuance of travel permits, determining when and where travel was allowed, determining who was allowed to travel, and establishing the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel"  ( #Vaporis_1994, 198). 

Vaporis comments that "regulations, while not without some effect, were not able to stem the irrepressible desire of the masses in Tokugawa Japan to travel" ( #Vaporis_1994, 198). However, in these examples of actions against pilgrimage, the these reasons appear to be to only limit possible negative economic effects. Were the authorities really trying to stem the desire to travel? 


### Economic gains of pilgrimage
Economic motivations: commerce from pilgrims

As seen in motivations to promote tourism by the oshi, there were a number of economic benefits of pilgrimage that were desired not just by the shrines and temples, but the various services that catered to travelers
others who stand to gain economically from their pilgrimage. 
Therefore, obstructing pilgrimage would hinder what had become an important industry for some regions, such as  Ōyama (Ambros 2008).

- Temples and shrines who receive funds from the talismans and offerings of pilgrims
- Merchants and peasants selling meibutsu specifically catering to pilgrims
- Lodging providers catering to pilgrims
- Traveling needs catering to pilgrims (luggage, traveling services, etc.)
#### Examples of daimyo and town authorities' efforts to encourage pilgrimage
There were even towns that arose and flourished due to the direct results of pilgrimage, therefore it came to be of significant economic importance for many regions. 

##### Sagami ( #Nenzi_2004)
*Kanagawa region*
Villages stopping practices that lessened pilgrim visitors 
##### Tosa ( #Roberts_1998)
*South region of Shikoku*
"The scabbard maker Zenpachi's petition gives another example of how this thought was not merely a means of arguing self-interest, but was a convincing. (141) way of understanding the economy and the lord's and people's roles within it.15 Not one of Zenpachi's ten suggestions had personal economic interest at stake, yet most were inspired in whole or in part by bullionist concerns and phrased in terms of kokueki" ( #Roberts_1998, 142).
"Zenpachi also urged the lord to promote religious tourism to Tosa's famous Godaisan temple by making entry into the country easy for foreigners at the temple's festival time. If this were done and the pilgrims increased, 'every year great amounts of foreign gold and silver would drop into the country, working eternally for the prosperity of the country and providing all of the people with a living'" (Roberts 1998, 142).
##### Oyama Cult (Hisashi, Edo, Shimosa) ( #Ambros_2008)

In Ambros's research (2008) of the pilgrimage to Ōyama, a popular shrine in the Kanto region, she argues that the community-building aspects pilgrimage reinforced social harmony, therefore, the bakufu was not against it. "The few regulations that pertained to it were not so much meant to limit the pilgrimage to Ōyama but more to ensure that pilgrims did not extend their pilgrimages unduly and maintained order on their journeys" (Ambros 2008, 173). 
The Ōyama pilgrimage also feuled the regional economy, by creating a demand for inns, ferries, and other travel related services (ibid, 148), and over time these nearby towns came to rely on Ōyama pilgrimage (150). This increase in commerce due to tourism brought by the pilgrims was not lost on the bakufu, she argues. While the bakufu's financial support of the Oyama shrine waned in the beginning of the Tokugawa period, their 

when the Ōyama clergy was supported by the bakufu authorities when they faced the **dispute in 1660s** (ibid, 90). 
"The regional make-up of the pilgrims reflects the overall distribution of Hachidayū’s parishes, which were concentrated in southeastern Musashi, Edo, and Shimōsa; therefore, the highest number of visitors (about 85 percent) came from these regions" (Ambros 2008, 163)

An important point observed by Ambros is that how a pilgrimage is conducted affects how the bakufu authorities react to it. She points out that both the bakufu and the regional communities did not seek to prevent journeys to Ōyama, "unless pilgrims either were behaving in wasteful ways or extended their journeys to too many sacred sites" (ibid, 161). In looking at the make-up of Ōyama pilgrims, she observes that they were largely from parishes or fraternities, and thus were not *nukemairi*, EXPLANATION.
"Confraternity members pooled their funds to finance the pilgrimage, and therefore the pilgrims were not a burden on communities along the route but fueled the regional economy" (ibid, 16). She argues that this is an important distinguishing difference in pilgrimage, and why the authorities supported Ōyama. 


%%"Long pilgrimages or impoverished travelers run counter to orderly ideals of bakufu while pilgrimages like Oyama reinforced social structures" (ibid, PAGE)%%

The bakufu's reaction to the Oyama pilgrimage provides insight into their 
##### Matsudaira (Aichi) and Kyogoku (Shikoku) families ( #Thal_2005)
*North region of Shikoku*

##### Authoritie's tolerance in Shikoku pilgrimage ( #Kouame_1997)
"the case of Shikoku could provide an example of the degree of tolerance seen in an administration renowned for its severity and the degree of flexibility of a social system known for its rigidity" ( #Kouame_1997, 414). 
"authorities did seek to regulate the pilgrims closely, and to proscribe unruly elements, they also provided a system of support for those in need who followed the regulations"( #Kouame_1997, 424).
Argues that local authorities should not be analyzed in terms of oppressive control. Benevolence relevant. 
"Indeed there are various historical materials that suggest that the general attitude of local authorities in Shikoku towards the henro should not be analyzed only in terms of repressive control. The fact is that the Shikoku authorities during the Tokugawa period did help pilgrims who were in trouble" ( #Kouame_1997, 421)
"in the context of the freedom that the authorities were actually granting, these regulations could be seen as comparatively insignificant constraints. ( #Kouame_1997, 424)
