Increase in tourism. Many historians present the situation as the authorities being clearly set against peasant pilgrimage and travel, implementing a system of barriers to impede their movement, barriers which the peasants found ways to circumvent. Other research into travel and the permit system, however, reveals that both the daimyo and bakufu were clearly tolerant towards allowing peasants to travel, showing hesitance to enforce the laws that controlled peasants mobility. 
%% the bakufu was reluctant to enforce travel limitations on peasants.%% 
%%the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it%%
I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the %%commercialization of travel  economic motivations behind travel promotion which gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a%% assumption that the authorities wished to restrict the movement of the peasants and does not take into account the economic benefits that the tourism from pilgrimage brought. The bakufu and daimyo's position was not authoritarian, but was focused on keeping their region prosperous. Using recent research that reveals cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that as long as travel did not negatively effect the peasant's production, the bakufu and daimyo had more reason to allow its practice because pilgrimage brought commerce due to its tourist nature. This explanation of the authorities' economic objective explains why they took steps to keep travel within reason, seeking to eliminate *nukemairi* pilgrimages which had a negative effect on the regions while making permits for ?? more easily obtainable.

## Introduction (850-1000 words)
As Japan entered an era of peace in the beginning of the Tokugawa period, the bakufu took steps to ensure that daimyo would not have the means to revolt by instiuting the alternate attendance system which required daimyo to make regular trips to Edo. In order to facilitate this compulsory travel, the bakufu instituted extensive infrastructure, building a centralized road network and positioned barrier stations, or *sekisho*, along its route in order to monitor movement. To facilitate traffic flowing smoothly, the roads were regularly cleaned, wheels that would damage the road surface were banned, and trees and shrubs were planted along the side of the road to provide shade and wind cover. The bakufu also established post stations that offered lodging, food, and travel services. While these services had to prioritize servicing Tokugawa officials and daimyo, they were allowed to cater to the lower classes.  These improvements to the travel network, combined with the lower classes of peasants and merchants began to find themselves with increasing financial freedom, made travel increasingly viable and led to a boom in pilgrimage. 
In order to pass through the many *sekisho* barriers along the highway, however, one needed to have a permit. Such a permit would not be issued for simply travel for pleasure, but a journey for the purpose of pilgrimage or visiting an onsen for health reasons was permissible. The advances in media captured the appeal of travel, describing famous sights and attractions, and many traveler guidebooks began to become commonplace. As pilgrimage became increasingly popular, sightseeing and enjoying local specialties began to common elements, sometimes even turning into the primary focus of the pilgrimage itself (REF). Thus a tourism industry slowly arose out of pilgrimage in Tokugawa Japan.

Despite the popularity of pilgrimage and sightseeing among commoners, however, many historians have argued that the bakufu and daimyo authorities were negatively positioned against peasant travel, and envisioned a society where the peasants "remained tied to the land" (Vaporis 1994, 136). 
At the same time, however, there is also research that reveals that the bakufu and daimyo were lenient in allowing travel of the lower classes (REF). In Vaporis' research on the roads and permit system ( #Vaporis , he observes that the checkpoint officials dealt with the travelling peasants with an increasing measure of laxity, in contrast to the strictness they showed samurai and upper classes. In addition, the changes that the bakufu make to the permit system made permit applications more flexible and easily obtained by peasants, a change that appears to be done in order to encourage travelers to apply for permits ( #Vaporis ). 

If were are to assume that the authorities were positioned against travel, then why do we observe such lenience towards it? While Vaporis' work presents clear evidence that authorities became more tolerant of peasant's pilgrimage, he does not directly pose the question of why. While his argument challenges the fact that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, pointing out that the peasants found ways to circumvent the barriers and thus were not immobile, he positions it as despite the intent or desire of the authorities. This paper presents an alternative perspective <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">that highlights the importance of the tourism industry.</mark>

I argue that these economic benefits to be gained from pilgrimage is highly relevant to understanding the lenience of the bakufu and daimyo because "[p]ilgrimage, and the service industry that supported it, was integral to the growing market economy of Tokugawa Japan" (Thal 2005, 102). This market economy was of great importance to the bakufu, as my previous research (Hall 2022) revealed in their efforts to manage the rice market. In this paper I argue that the bakufu's concern with the economic potential of pilgrimage is because the governance of the Tokugawa regime was not authoritarian, but socially responsive ( #Paramore_2012 ) and primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity.  Because they were more focused on keeping a prosperous country and not interesting in strictly managing the lower classes, they would be approving of the rise of the tourism industry from pilgrimage.

First I present research that reveals **how pilgrimage turned into a consumerist tourism industry.** The economic potential of these travelers was realized by the shrine and temples Oshi, who promoted and organized pilgrim's travel and organize travel for pilgrims. Their efforts resulted in the increase of pilgrims (REF) and over time other local entities began to vie for the service of those travelers. The tourism industry that emerged from this came to be vital to many regions. 

Next I look at **how authorities respond to this industry**, using research that reveals cases of positive responses from authorities and communities who take steps to allow and support pilgrimage travel (Ambros 2008, Kouame 1997,  Thal 2005), and cases where the authorities take steps to restrict pilgrimage (Vaporis ?). I argue that in both cases the main factor was the economic effect of pilgrimage, thus we see the authorities limiting it when it has negative affects on region and allowing or promoting it when those affects are positive or neutral.

Finally, I argue the reason **Tokugawa authorities were primarily concerned with the economy was due to their style of governance**. Because they were moving away from authoritarian methods and saw that allowing the lower classes to be prosperous would result in their own prosperity, as the entire tax system was based on the efforts of the farmer. To support this argument I present research that reveals the bottom-up style of governance that looks more democratic than authoritarian (Paramore 2012), and research that shows benevolent ruling was becoming more common and linked to a region's prosperity (Hall 1966). While this research might argue that the basis for this style of governance was largely based in Confucianism, I argue that another reason to be economic. As my previous research on the rice tax revealed, the bakufu were focused on the economy and saw it in their own wellbeing to benevolently leave the peasants with a surplus, because it led to an overall increase in rice tax and an increase in other commodities. 

From this research I argue that the economic potential of pilgrimage, exploited by religiously offiliated oshi, popularized by media and enhanced by the competition of regional businesses, and facilitated by the Tokugawa style of governance. 
This research is important not just in understanding the motivations of the authorities, but emphasizes the economic value of pilgrimage as essential to understanding why travel became so prevalent among the Edo populace.

**position of benevolent ruler** and being primarily concerned with the economy and region's prosperity. 
Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up ( #Paramore_2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" ( #Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule ( #Cambridge, #Hall_1966 ). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" ( #Vaporis 1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.

Though Blacker does admit that some daimyo did not object when the travel was undertaken during the idle part of the year. 

The bakufu envisioned the peasant's being tied to the land ( #Vaporis), as the rice crops were the  
Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF). 

However, the question that Vaporis does not ask is why the authorities were so lax in allowing pilgrimage, despite what he argues as clear motivations against it #Nosco_1996 .
In line with many other historians, he has argued at length how the authorities were bent on preventing the peasant's ability to travel, detailing the negative effects from pilgrimage and how the authorities envisioned the peasants being tied to the land. As both the bakufu and daimyo's income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities.

### Argument by Historians

In much of the literature on travel during the Edo period there is an overall perception that the bakufu and daimyo held a position against pilgrimage, wishing to restrict unnecessary movement of the peasants ( #Kanzaki_1995, #Vaporis_2012, #Watkins_2008), particularly of restrictive of women  #Nenzi_2004). While they do not clearly ask the question of why the bakufu might be against pilgrimage, some mention economical factors (Blacker 1984, Traganou 2004, Vaporis 1994). They explain that this is because travel could interfere with the farmer's agricultural production, to which both the bakufu and daimyo's finances were directly tied. In addition, travelling expenses meant money would be leaving the region. Besides these economic reasons, there is also the argument that the pilgrimage itself posed a threat to bakufu's authority (Traganou 2004), and the "harassing restrictions" imposed by daimyo were because they viewed the peasant's travel as "frivolous, useless, extravagant and immoral", and neglection of the peasant's "proper duty" ( #Blacker_1984 , 604). 

Blacker : "Carmen Blacker, for example, argues that the archetypal pilgrim is the mendicant ( yugyōsha), a wandering ascetic, who often appeared in art and literature throughout Japanese history. Blacker holds that temporary pilgrims who absconded to the Ise Shrines or traveled along the long circuit in Shikoku emulated the ideal of the solitary mendicant and turned to pilgrimage as a means of escape from the confines of the ordinary world, forsaking their community for an individualistic spiritual journey. During the early modern period, such mendicancy was regarded as antisocial and disruptive by bakufu and domainal authorities." Ambros 

Against pilgrimage because it has anti-structural elements, but not all pilgrimages the same (ambros)
"Eade and Sallnow have pointed out that large, highly popular pilgrimage destinations often “develop more permanent economic infrastructures for dealing with the continual influx of pilgrims.” Unlike Turner, they conclude that “distasteful as such commercialism might appear . . . it is nevertheless a piece with the religious dealings taking place within the cult itself.”" Ambros 146

Vaporis as well references hard evidence on what the authorities thought of the peasants undertaking pilgrimage. 
These statements are from only single individuals and therefore may not reflect the majority of opinions and overall stance of the bakufu. 

However, the actual situation at the barriers and actions of the authorities in response to growing peasant pilgrimage reveals their tolerance of travel and flexibility of the system. 
Vaporis describes the many cases of laxity where checkpoint officials allowed passage for peasants without permits or letting slide permit related offenses. What are we to make of this apparent paradox?

In Vaporis's study of the road barriers the travel permit system of the Tokugawa period, he challenges the idea that the authorities fully controlled the peasants' movements, and argues that the peasants found ways to circumvent the barriers. 
Vaporis argues against accepting a "legalistic interpretation of Tokugawa Japan" (6), as doing so overestimates the state's authority and incorrectly represents peasants as immobile, with their movements severely restricted and strictly inspected at barriers. His conclusion is that despite the intention of the authorities, the *sekisho* barriers did not significantly impede peasant travelers (ibid, 7)


The position of the authorities has been against pilgrimage in spite of its popularity.

Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
While the religious aspects of pilgrimage may played a part in softening the perspective of some authorities towards it, I argue that it does not fully explain. 


benevolent ruler position held by the bakufu authorities, which the daimyo largely followed (REF). 

#### Vaporis

As Nosco has noted, 

"This study, furthermore, will show that government policy regarding
travel was, on the whole, positive rather than repressive; the application of regulations was far more flexible than suggested by statute. This growing flexibility in a system that originally had been more rigid allowed for-and in fact promoted-the increasing mobility that characterized Tokugawa Japan from the eighteenth century on." (Vaporis 1994, 5)

Perhaps the most persuasive argument that would explain the authorities desire to restrict or ban pilgrimage is of an economic origin. Vaporis explains how travelling into other regions meant that money leaving the domain caused concern for the ruler. For example, when the Kaga domain restricted pilgrimage to a popular Kyoto shrine, they claimed it was to "stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver" ( #Vaporis_1994, 202).

"regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control" ( #Vaporis_1994, 198).

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. The changes by the Kaga and  domains as well seem reactionary as they made the permit application process for more simple. He observes that "[t]his was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them on nukemairi" ( #Vaporis_1994, 173). While making no comment on nukemairi has been argued to be damaging to the economy, 

"Rather than come out against pilgrimage with strong measures and
enforced punishments, government authorities were content to issue and re-issue prohibitiens which were hortatory in nature and thereby functioned more as sumptuary legislation" (Vaporis 1994, 215)
"Officials frequently bent the rules for travelers with defective permits, and sometimes downgraded travel offenses to avoid having to prosecute commoners (ibid 216)

Vaporis comments that "regulations, while not without some effect, were not able to stem the irrepressible desire of the masses in Tokugawa Japan to travel" ( Vaporis 1994, 198). Because the examples of actions against pilgrimage appear to be to limit its negative economic effects, were the authorities really trying to stem the desire to travel? 

I would argue that allowing peasants to acquire permits more easily reveals their  underlying motivation to stem pilgrimage that could harm a region's economy while promoting pilgrimage that could positively increase that economy. Indeed, Vaporis even observes some domains regulating pilgrimage by "setting certain economic qualifications for the issuance of travel permits, determining when and where travel was allowed, determining who was allowed to travel, and establishing the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel"  ( Vaporis 1994, 198). While he argues that this reflects the authorities' position against pilgrimage, I would argue that it shows their acceptance of it as they try to keep it within reasonable bounds. 

### Commercialization of Pilgrimage 
( #Ishimori_2009)

The commercialization of travel 

Pilgrimage led to contents tourism ( #SeatonEtal_2017) 

consumer pilgrims (Nenzi 2004). Looking at the factors that led to the pilgrimage boom, the economic motivations become obvious,
with parties who worked to popularize pilgrimage were those who sought to gain economically from it. These main instigators of that promotion are what have been described as the first travel agent: the temple and shrine affiliated *oshi*. They worked to attract pilgrims to shrines and temples in order to make up for the lost financial support that had come from the daimyo and bakufu. 
#### Travel Promotion by the Oshi 
Promotion of travel was largely due to the efforts of the *onshi* or *oshi*, 
who in addition to promoting travel to temples, offered to arrange for the pilgrim's accommodation and provided useful travel information. In looking at how they operate, they have been argued to be the "originators of the tourist industry in Japan" ( #Kanzaki_1995, 49). They were  affiliated with temples and shrines, and originally being ?? they began to take on the form of ?. 

In Ambros's research of the Ōyama shrine in the Kanto area (2008), she argues that these oshi were the key players in growing the popularity of pilgrimage, and it was due to the oshi's efforts that transformed the Ōyama religious site into such a major tourist destination. 

"They were generally run by those connected to religious establishments, such as low level priests called onshi or oshi, who posted their subordinates and deputies around the country to act as tour guides. These priests contributed greatly to ･the institutionalization of package tours. .. These examples show that in Japan religious offcials had a role in institutionalizing the travel industry from before the Edo period" ( #Tadao_1995, 6).

While originally much like a missionary, over time they "became more merchants than priests, each with their own territory" ( #Kanzaki_1995, ?). 

"The same style of entertainment continued after the oshi became independent from the shrine and started to do business with ordinary people, in the Edo period, but underneath the hospitality lay a cunning business spirit. . What they intended was advertisement with maximum effect ( #Kanzaki_1995, 48)".

The financial gain that came from pilgrimage was not something that was felt by shrines and temples alone, however. While talismans and religious offerings were important elements of one's pilgrimage, the commerce potential of pilgrims was much larger. Accommodation along one's journey was essential,

Souvenirs to bring back to the pilgrim's hometown had become an important aspect of the trip itself, as it gave validation of one's travels and offered the experience with those of the village who could not visit themselves. 

Teahouses and brothels also quickly became popular stops on one's pilgrimage, with some prostitute becoming as famous (REF). 

Therefore, obstructing pilgrimage would hinder what had become an important industry of tourist consumerism. 


#### Consumer Pilgrims ( #Nenzi_2004)
*Kanagawa region*

Nenzi's research (2004) into the changing interactions of travelers and their destinations during the Edo period reveals the degree to which that consumerism arose from pilgrimage. Using as a case study the region of Sagami, located in modern day Kanagawa prefecture, Nenzi argues that over time the attractions that drew pilgrims to this area developed into a commodification of local history and regional specialties, revealing a new common type of pilgrim that Nenzi calls the "consumer tourist" (ibid 286). 

As she traces the changes that occurred in this region, she observes many cases of conflict between regional parties as they competed for profits from pilgrims. 

%%To resolve this conflict, these parties turn to the regional governments and Edo authorities to stop practices that resulted in the decline of pilgrim visitors.%%

In one example from 1650, the head of a temple of the goddess Benzaiten in Enoshima complained that local fisherman were selling the diety's amulets and leading travelers to their own establishments, instead of telling them how to reach the temple lodgings. This results in a loss of income for the temple, thus they petitioned the shrine and temple magistrate in Edo to put a stop to those legitimate inns. The response from the magistrate was a compromise, allowing the private non-temple affiliated inns to be run when there was an overflow of travelers which the temple could not accommodate. As for the amulet distribution, it could continue as long as "those who benefited from it also provide services to the temple" (Nenzi 2004, 306). 
Despite this ruling, the fishermen and other local entrepreneurs continued to target pilgrims, and over the decades tensions between them and the temple grew. However by the nineteenth century the number of pilgrims grew to the point that the temple infrastructure could not handle their accommodation, and here Nenzi observes the temple's efforts of commercialism as they offered various accommodations packages and special amenities, and provided elaborate meals and entertainment to guests.

Nenzi also observes a similar trend of competition for the profits from pilgrims in the region around Ōyama, where in the latter part of the eighteenth-century quarrels arose over packhorse fares and lodgings of pilgrims (ibid 308). By 1840 local inn and village leaders made an agreement to resolve the issues of lost profit from pilgrims by lowering ferry fares and elimination of regional tolls, which had been causing travelers to choose alternate routes. "These official ordinances and self-imposed codes of conduct intended to regulate the proliferation of traffic indicate the growing complexity of the space of travel and the increasing weight of consumer logic" (ibid 309). 

Nenzi also observes this consumer logic at the religious institutions of Ōyama, who had to offer pilgrims not just things of spiritual value, but also "immediate gratifications", such as souvenirs shops, teahouses, restaurants, and baggage delivery services. 

*Meibutsu* also became an important element for travelers, and locations began to advertise the local specialty cuisine as a marketing strategy in order to promote their popularity. Nenzi observes that the creation of many popular travel destinations was owed to the presence of a *meibutsu* (2004, 302). "Gastronomies and knickknacks provided a convenient way to forge a link with a travel destination for those who did not wish to experiment with the ethereal and often slippery pillow words of poetic travel. Lacking a formal education no longer precluded one from symbolically “owning” a site—all it took now was a string of coins and, sometimes, an appetite" (Nenzi 2008, 155)


"As commercialism burgeoned and the historical icons of the past became the trinkets and menu items of the present, the modalities of the interaction between visitors and sites also expanded dramatically, taking on new nuances that did not replace but complemented the old ones" (Nenzi 2008, 154)

"As visitors demanded to access and possess sites by way of tangible amenities, the travel industry responded with a proliferation of merchandise and self-referential simulacra. In late Edo Japan, a traveler’s ability to acquire a site by means of purchasable commodities represented an important com­plement to historical, literary, or religious escapism. Tangible objects and local specialties had become the material equivalents of a quotation, the commodi­fied counterparts of an intellectual, intertextual engagement. Through such commercial icons of escapism the spaces of travel multiplied ad infinitum, becoming domesticated, pervasive, and attainable by way of a simple ­monetary transaction" (Nenzi 2008, 156)
%%The gastronomic element of travel became so important, that by the 1800's the pilgrims to Ōyama who might have been drawn by the mountain's sacred aura, "were not fully satisfied unless the complex catered to their less spiritual appetites as well" (ibid, 304).%% 

Nenzi observes new attractions in pilgrimage that came consumption of non-religious elements,


The Ōyama pilgrimage also fueled the regional economy, by creating a demand for inns, ferries, and other travel related services (Ambros 2008, 148), and over time these nearby towns came to rely on Ōyama pilgrimage (ibid, 150).

***Section conclusion***
The commerce that pilgrimage brought to a region was not something that could be dismissed by the bakufu and daimyo as unnecessary or unwanted. "Catering to pilgrims by providing food, lodging, and entertainment at religious sites was the foundation of much of the modern Japanese tourism industry" (Seaton et al 2017, 20). 

As profits were realized by appealing to this consumer pilgrim, competition arose and 
These examples show just how important the tourism industry that arose from pilgrimage.  

### Authorities Response to Pilgrimage
In recent years, historians have approached the topic of Edo period travel from many different angles, asking new questions about why pilgrimage became so widely practiced and how it turned into what we recognize today as tourism. While their purpose is to understand more about how and why people traveled, their research reveals cases of lenience shown to pilgrims by village and daimyo authorities, as they take efforts to manage and provide care for travelers (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">as in the case of sickness or death)</mark>. Another perspective this research reveals is how important of an industry pilgrimage became in the Edo period, with some towns arising or flourishing due to the direct results of pilgrimage. It is clear that pilgrimage and the tourism that came with it grew to be of significant economic importance for many regions in Edo period Japan. 

##### Tosa ( #Roberts_1998)
*South region of Shikoku*
"The scabbard maker Zenpachi's petition gives another example of how this thought was not merely a means of arguing self-interest, but was a convincing. (141) way of understanding the economy and the lord's and people's roles within it.15 Not one of Zenpachi's ten suggestions had personal economic interest at stake, yet most were inspired in whole or in part by bullionist concerns and phrased in terms of kokueki" ( #Roberts_1998, 142).
"Zenpachi also urged the lord to promote religious tourism to Tosa's famous Godaisan temple by making entry into the country easy for foreigners at the temple's festival time. If this were done and the pilgrims increased, 'every year great amounts of foreign gold and silver would drop into the country, working eternally for the prosperity of the country and providing all of the people with a living'" (Roberts 1998, 142).
##### Ōyama Cult (Hisashi, Edo, Shimosa) ( #Ambros_2008)
In Ambros's research (2008) of the pilgrimage to Ōyama, a popular shrine in the Kanto region, she argues that the community-building aspects pilgrimage reinforced social harmony, therefore, the bakufu was not against it. "The few regulations that pertained to it were not so much meant to limit the pilgrimage to Ōyama but more to ensure that pilgrims did not extend their pilgrimages unduly and maintained order on their journeys" (Ambros 2008, 173). 

Argues that the contraints of the domainal authorities of Shikoku were cases where they "perceived religious travel as a burden on the communities that hosted pilgrims as well as on the home communities left behind" (2008, 146)


This increase in commerce brought by tourism from the pilgrims was not lost on the bakufu, she argues. 

when the Ōyama clergy was supported by the bakufu authorities when they faced the **dispute in 1660s** (ibid, 90). 
"The regional make-up of the pilgrims reflects the overall distribution of Hachidayū’s parishes, which were concentrated in southeastern Musashi, Edo, and Shimōsa; therefore, the highest number of visitors (about 85 percent) came from these regions" (Ambros 2008, 163)

An important point observed by Ambros is that how a pilgrimage is conducted affects how the bakufu authorities react to it. She points out that both the bakufu and the regional communities did not seek to prevent journeys to Ōyama, "unless pilgrims either were behaving in wasteful ways or extended their journeys to too many sacred sites" (ibid, 161). In looking at the make-up of Ōyama pilgrims, she observes that they were largely from parishes or fraternities, and thus were not *nukemairi*, EXPLANATION.
"Confraternity members pooled their funds to finance the pilgrimage, and therefore the pilgrims were not a burden on communities along the route but fueled the regional economy" (ibid, 16). She argues that this is an important distinguishing difference in pilgrimage, and why the authorities supported Ōyama. 



%%"Long pilgrimages or impoverished travelers run counter to orderly ideals of bakufu while pilgrimages like Ōyama reinforced social structures" (ibid, PAGE)%%

The bakufu's reaction to the Ōyama pilgrimage provides insight into their 
##### Matsudaira (Aichi) and Kyogoku (Shikoku) families ( #Thal_2005)
*North region of Shikoku*

"The priests of Konpira, like priests of other would be pilgrimage sites, simultaneously developed the attractions of both the god and the town to boost the economic viability of the sacred domain" (3)
"Thus, from early on, Konpira's development as an attractive site of worship proceeded in tandem with the popularity of its markets and entertainments. In the phenomenon common to pilgrimates sites in Japan and around the world, Mt. Zozu and its gods grew amid a bustling pilgrimage economy of entertainments and commerce: performances, prostitution, and gambling proved as integral to the growth of the sites as amulets and worship (3)"
"The priests of Konkoin catered to such demand for entertainment in order to raise both the income and the status of the sacred domain" (5) Thal mentions the lavish festivals and parades, 
The support of Konpira offered social benefits as well. Thal describes how the supporting domain families, Matsudaira and Kyogoku, mutually benefited all parties, "weaving the sacred domain of Konpira [...] into an expanding network of personal, economic, and ritual relationships"

"Encouraged by entrepreneurs in the pilgrimage business and in the media, the cult of Konpira grew throughout the 1700s and early 1800s, eventually forming a prominent part of popular nineteenth-century culture" (99)

"By the early 1800s, pilgrimage to Konpira  began to rival pilgrimage to Ise, with as many as half the pilgrims to Ise continuing on to visit Konpira, and large numbers traveling to Konpira from western Japan as well" (102)

"growth of the pilgrimage to Konpira seems to have relied as much on business owners as it did on priests affiliated with the site" (102)
##### Tolerance in Shikoku ( #Kouame_1997)

*Natalie Kouamé argues that the Shikoku pilgrimage flourished particularly in the late seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries.* 

"the case of Shikoku could provide an example of the degree of tolerance seen in an administration renowned for its severity and the degree of flexibility of a social system known for its rigidity" ( #Kouame_1997, 414). 

"authorities did seek to regulate the pilgrims closely, and to proscribe unruly elements, they also provided a system of support for those in need who followed the regulations"( #Kouame_1997, 424).
Argues that local authorities should not be analyzed in terms of oppressive control. Benevolence relevant. 
"Indeed there are various historical materials that suggest that the general attitude of local authorities in Shikoku towards the henro should not be analyzed only in terms of repressive control. The fact is that the Shikoku authorities during the Tokugawa period did help pilgrims who were in trouble" ( #Kouame_1997, 421)

Kouame argues that when looking at the level of freedom that the authorities were granting pilgrims, the constraints of the regulations were comparatively insignificant (ibid 424).

%%"in the context of the freedom that the authorities were actually granting, these regulations could be seen as comparatively insignificant constraints ( #Kouame_1997, 424)
%%
### Tokugawa's governance
The image of Tokugawa bakufu is often portrayed as authoritarian, with "squeezing of the peasants" and limiting all their freedom (REF), however recent historians have presented a different perspective. 



Position of authorities: benevolent ruler, desire to manage not domineer

- Policies in place, but actual implementation of them up to the person in charge. 
- Soft rules that can adapt to circumstances. 

While #Gordon_2003 and #Tanimoto_2019  argue that the Confucian concept of benevolence was not popular in the seventeenth century, pointing out the authoritarian "squeezing of the peasants". 
in some instances, such as civil engineering infrastructure, the economic interests of the authorities and the common people likely overlapped  #Tanimoto_2019 . 

as I argued in paper on the rice tax (Hall 2022), the fact that the authorities left the peasants with a surplus reflects their priority of managing the economy and regional prosperity. Perhaps what benevolence represents the idea that if the people are prosperous, those ruling them will also be part in this prosperity. 
This observation that the government is concerned with the well-being of the lower class is also reflected in Bizen's example of a benevolent ruler by John Hall ( #Hall_1966 1966). Hall argues that that Mitsumasa of the Bizen province provides "one of the best examples of the successful daimyo of the Tokugawa age" (ibid, 403) and this type of administration was typical of of the larger daimyo during the Tokugawa period (ibid, 410). Hall also points out that "The Tokugawa bakufu had led the way in drawing upon the concepts of Confucianism and seeking ideological justification for its regime in the claims of benevolent government" (ibid, 403). More specific example of that government's political stance can be seen in Paramore's research ( #Paramore_2012 2012) on changes in governance that occurred during the later half of Tokugawa period. Refuting the arguments that Neo-Confucian political concepts encouraged authoritarianism, he argues that governmental changes were usually designed to open up the decision making process to more people, and can be seen as "an attempt to generate more socially engaged, inclusive, and responsive governance" (ibid, 27). 

This argument against the idea that the Tokugawa government was top-down and authoriatian
#### Leaving peasants with surplus
In my previous research ( #Hall_2022), I argued that the position of the shogunate was focused on keeping a balanced rice market, and to that end they intentionally left a surplus of rice with the peasants. I believe this to be an example of their underlying economic motivations and how that led them to govern with a degree of benevolence. Like their actions with the rice tax, if the pilgrimage of the peasants had a positive economic impact, and as long as that travel did not hinder the crop yields, the bakufu would be more inclined to allow it, making changing to keep in within the confines that prevented economic harm to the region (**as one historian mentions)** than to spend more effort and money into micromanaging. Indeed, the majority of peasants traveled in their free time after their farmer's responsibilities were fulfilled (REF). 

Indeed, Vaporis notices the regulations dealing with pilgrimage have to do with economic reasons, though he fails to make the statement that 

make the system more suitable in response to the needs of the people, instead of trying to control what the people needed. 



## Conclusion
Sum up the reasons for tourism and how they outweigh against tourism. If the authorities were more concerned about economy and managing the country, it is understandable why they would not hinder pilgrimage and only lightly voice "unnecessary travel".

### Why this research is meaningful	
This research will reveal not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, but also the shows the underlying motivations behind the bakufu and ruling authorities' actions and how they dealt with the lower class. These points are both vital to understanding  what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan.
