## Abstract

Increase in tourism. While many historians claim the authorities to be clearly set against commoner pilgrimage and travel, the increase is clearly linked to laxity of authorities in allowing it. I argue that the explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the economic motivations that gave rise to mass peasant pilgrimage, and a misunderstanding of the position of the authorities towards commoners. Using recent research that reveals the economic motivations that lie behind both the travel agent like oshi who encouraged peasants to travel and the cases where communities and town authorities petition to increase pilgrimage, I argue that the economic benefits of pilgrimage combined with the bakufu's position of being a "benevolent'" ruler gave them less incentive to stop the peasants from traveling than it did to simply manage the system to keep up with the sudden surge of pilgrimage travel.  

## Introduction

However, many historians have argued that that the ruling authorities were negatively positioned against peasant pilgrimage, claiming that the bakufu envisioned peasant's being tied to the land (Vaporis). Reasons for such a position have been argued to be due to the negative economic effects on the income they received due to the peasant's efforts at their fields (REF). It is this position of the ruling authorities wherein questions arise; if the bakufu and daimyo authorities were positioned against travel, why were the permits that were necessary for travel able to obtained so easily by commoners? Why did the checkpoint officials show more laxity to the peasants as time went on? In order to understand the bakufu's motivations, I believe it is necessary to examine the situation surrounding pilgrimage itself. In recent years, historians have approached the topic from many different angles asking new questions about how and why pilgrimage became so widely practiced. Based on this research, this paper will reexamine previous evidence used in determine the position of the authorities

,  what reasons they could have to be for or against pilgrimage, and with that position in mind, consider the economic effects of pilgrimage. 


#### Outline
**Background:** Brief explanation of rise of pilgrimage and its change to sightseeing and tourism
This rise is a result increased **ability** and **motivation** to undertake pilgrimage which grew during the Edo period. 
**What hasn't already been said by the literature:**  Recent research has revealed much about the motivations. However in the ability to travel, one question is still unclear; the laxity of the authorities against peasant pilgrimage. Historian Vaporis has dealt with this topic in great detail and outlines the numerous instances of authorities being negatively positioned against peasant pilgrimage and instances where it was banned. However, as Nosco (1996) pointed out in his review of Vaporis' work, the question Vaporis fails to specifically ask is why the laxity occurred despite what he argues as clear motivations against it. 
**Question:** However, there appears to be a contradiction in the position of the authorities and their actions that gave the peasants the ability to travel. When considering the position of the authorities against tourism, **why their laxity** towards it? That laxity is possibly a large factor in pilgrimage's increase.
There are religious, economic, and social factors that surround the surge in pilgrimage, but none of them would have been possible had the authorities not been so lax with letting pilgrims travel. Vaporis describes some of the social factors, alluding that because pilgrimage was seen as a rite of passage and worshiping at shrines such as Ise were connected to the Emperor's authority, restricting pilgrimage could have negative repercussions for them. However, Vaporis does not clearly state these as being the reason behind bakufu's laxity. 
**Answer:** While social acceptance of pilgrimage could have been influential,  I argue that the reason for the authorities laxity towards peasant pilgrimage was the bakufu's economic focus and position toward the peasants of benevolent ruler. Because they were more focused on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">keeping a propserous country rather than lording over the lower class</mark> ,  the the economic factors surrounding pilgrimage 
that are the primary reason which  affected the their desire and ability to restrict the movements of the lower class. Specifically, the rise of pilgrimage tourism as an industry and the economic benefits thereof. 
Therefore, I argue that the reason for this laxity lies in:
- **economic motivations to encourage pilgrimage**
	Evidence: 
	- cases where they limit pilgrimage are for their negative affects on region. They never seek to stop pilgrimage itself.
- **position of benevolent ruler** and being more concerned with economy than domineering commoner's lives. 
	Evidence: 
	- Confucian based Tokugawa was not authoritarian but bottom up (Paramore 2012)
	- Oda and Ieyasu's leadership policies and idea of "men of the realm" (Cambridge History, *need reference*)
	- Confucian precepts of benevolent rule (Cambridge, Hall). Indeed Vaporis himself mentions "Considerable benevolence was shown by officials to commoners caught trying to go through or around sekisho illegally" (1994, 180) despite his position that authorities were set against letting commoners travel.
	- Reference work of leaving peasants with surplus for overall economic benefit. Perhaps they have more to lose than to gain if they go against the commoners. Perhaps the idea of them being against pilgrimage is based on a few writings without taking their overall actions into account.
**Conclusion:** Sum up the reasons for tourism and how they outweigh against tourism. If the authorities were more concerned about economy and managing the country, it is understandable why they would not hinder pilgrimage and only lightly voice "unnecessary travel".
**Why this research is meaningful:** This research will reveal not only the situation that faced peasants as they began to enjoy the freedom of pilgrimage and sightseeing, but also the shows the underlying motivations behind the bakufu and ruling authorities' actions and how they dealt with the lower class. These points are both vital to understanding  what can be argued to be the first tourism industry for commoners, the mass pilgrimage of Edo Japan. 

To understand this economic element, it is first necessary to understand the situation surrounding pilgrimage. Therefore I will briefly outline the rise in pilgrimage the primary factors that led to its increase. 

## Background: The rise of tourism pilgrimage

Along with other historians, it is clear that peasant pilgrimage greatly increased over the course of the Edo period, and subsequently turned into a tourism industry, with sightseeing and enjoying local specialties. In other words, it slowly came to be more complex than just shrine and temple visits. When looking at tourism historically, Japan was early in commoner's being able to travel, especially when compared to European countries, where it was largely limited to nobility (REF). Trying to understand how and why this increase came about, historians have pointed out various factors, ranging from economic to religious, but I believe they can be organized into two categories;  motivation and ability. 
#### Motivation
Travel in the Edo period was quite arduous the majority of peasant's travel was on foot (REF). Depending on the destination, pilgrimage could take many days, and sometimes many weeks, to complete, costing both time, effort and money. Thus the motivation to set out on a pilgrimage is necessary. 
As motivation for undertaking such a journey, research has revealed primary two main factors; the popular image of pilgrimage held by society and its direct promotion by those affiliated with shrines and temples. 
- the image of pilgrimage gained from popular media.
	- sacred wanderer image (REF)
	- rite of passage by overcoming hardships of travel (REF)
- the direct promotion of pilgrimage along with offering convenience of lodgings and travel information. oshi, by what would later be called the worlds first travel agents. who promoted temples and are agued to be the first travel agents. (REF)
I believe the third factor to be of most significance, as it explains the motivations of peasants themselves to undertake pilgrimage, as well as the motivations of others who stand to gain economically from their pilgrimage. 

- Temples and shrines who receive funds from the talismans and offerings of pilgrims
- Merchants and peasants selling meibutsu specifically catering to pilgrims
- Lodging providers catering to pilgrims
- Traveling needs catering to pilgrims (luggage, traveling services, etc.)
There were even towns that arose and flourished due to the direct results of pilgrimage, therefore it came to be of significant economic importance for many regions. 

The motivations to undertake pilgrimage and to promote pilgrimage are clear, so moving to the ability needs clarification. 
#### Ability
In research that reveals the peasant's ability to travel, historians have pointed to the countrywide road system and the permit system. The road (REF) which<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> was kept well maintained and in Edo's time of peace could be travelled safely</mark>. While originally laid out by the bakufu for the alternate attendance system of the daimyo, it was able to be used by commoners as well. Inns and other services at checkpoints had to prioritize daimyo (REF), but they were still allowed to accommodate the lower class. 
However, in order to pass through the many checkpoints along the highway, one needed to have a permit. Such a permit would not be issued for simply travel for pleasure, but a journey for the purpose of pilgrimage was permissible.  
- the permit system and how peasant's could obtain a pass in order to proceed through the many barrier checkpoints positioned around the country. 
- Laxity of the permit system and checkpoints, despite shogunate wanting peasants to stay at their fields and refrain from travel (REF)
- Position of authorities: benevolent ruler, desire to manage not domineer
- Economic motivations: commerce from pilgrims

Perhaps the most detailed research on peasant's ability to travel has been conducted by Vaporis in his papers about the road conditions and many barriers, both physical and social. In line with many other historians, he has argued at length how the authorities were bent on preventing the peasant's ability to travel, detailing the negative effects from pilgrimage and how the authorities envisioned the peasants being tied to the land. As both the bakufu and daimyo's income came directly from the peasant's efforts in their fields, it is understandable how travel away from one's region could have negative repercussions in the eyes of those authorities.
However, in his detailed account of the permit system and how it changed over the years, Vaporis reveals that not only does the bakufu and checkpoint officials deal with the peasants who travel with a measure of laxity, over time that laxity increases and changes to the permit system do not obstruct peasant pilgrimage, only encourage permit taking. In other words, the position of officials, which historians' have argued to be against peasant travel, does not match the actions they have taken in response. While Vaporis' research presents a clear view of the situation that became more tolerant of peasant's pilgrimage, he fails to ask why this trend occurred. If the bakufu authorities had aspirations for control over the peasants to keep them tied to their lands, why do the changes to the permit system only make them more flexible and easily obtained? While this question remains unasked in Vaporis' many writings pertaining to travel, I believe the answer lies in the motivations that gave the commoners reasons to undertake pilgrimage. Looking at research from other historians, many have argued the negative perspective of authorities towards peasant travel, usually referencing Vaporis' work. However, in the last few decades as the social dynamics of the Edo period peasants has become a topic of interest,  the research of other historians has revealed cases of indifference and even positive perceptions of pilgrimage by authorities. 
This research on the motivations for travel will .


###### Motivation
- Promotion of travel by religiously affiliated Oshi, who are argued to be much like a travel agent, arranging accommodation and providing travel information (REF)
- A positive travel image with connotations of religious image of a sacred wanderer and seen as a rite of passage (REF 

## Why were authorities lax with peasant pilgrimage?

#### Why be against pilgrimage?
In the many articles on travel in the Edo period there is an overall perception that the bakufu and daimyo held a position against pilgrimage, wishing to restrict uncessary movement (Kanzaki 1995, Vaporis 2012, Watkins 2008), particularly of women (Nenzi 2004). In Vaporis' many works on the travel permit system, he often mentions how the authorities idealized a society where the peasants "remained tied to the land" (1994, 136). Along with historian Traganou (2004) who wrote at length on traveling the Tokaido Road, Vaporis explain this desire to keep farmers at their land is because travel might reduce agricultural production. Because both the bakufu and daimyo's finances are directly tied to the production of the lands farmed by the peasants, this would appear to be logical reaction. Moving economic reasons, however, Traganou (2004) argues that the pilgrimage itself posed a threat to bakufu's authority. Vaporis as well references hard evidence on what the authorities thought of the peasants undertaking pilgrimage. 

At the same time, Vaporis describes the many cases of laxity where checkpoint officials allowed passage for peasants without permits or letting slide permit related offenses. What are we to make of this apparent paradox?

These statements are from only single individuals and therefore may not reflect the majority of opinions and overall stance of the bakufu. Taking the perspective of the historians above and assuming that the bakufu were against peasant pilgrimage, then why would they not have taken steps to restrict it? By examining the bakufu's possible motives might reveal their position towards travel.    


Perhaps the most persuasive argument that would explain the authorities desire to restrict or ban pilgrimage is of an economic origin. Vaporis explains how travelling into other regions meant that money leaving the domain caused concern for the ruler. For example, when the Kaga domain restricted pilgrimage to a popular Kyoto shrine, they claimed it was to "stem the outflow of precious domain resources like gold and silver" (Vaporis 1994, 202).

Reasons to be against it
"regulations dealing with commoner travel were issued frequently and were inspired mainly by economics rather than a desire for totalitarian control" (Vaporis 1994, 198).

Vaporis does observe how bakufu officials did make reactionary changes to the permit system, though he describes them as trying to accommodate the large numbers of people who wanted to travel, instead of strongly coming out against pilgrimage itself. The changes by the Kaga and  domains as well seem reactionary as they made the permit application process for more simple. He observes that "[t]his was done to encourage commoners to apply for travel permits, rather than to leave home without them on nukemairi" (Vaporis 1994, 173). While making no comment on  nukemairi has been argued to be damaging to the economy, allowing those people to acquire permits gives us the image that the underlying motivation was to urge people to follow the system, in other words, make the system more suitable in response to the needs of the people, instead of trying to control what the people needed. 




"Some of the ways domains sought to regulate pilgrimage were setting certain economic qualifications for the issuance of travel permits, determining when and where travel was allowed, determining who was allowed to travel, and establishing the length of time as well as the number of times a person could travel"  (Vaporis 1994, 198). 

Vaporis comments that "regulations, while not without some effect, were not able to stem the irrepressible desire of the masses in Tokugawa Japan to travel" (1994, 198). However, in these examples of actions against pilgrimage, the these reasons appear to be to only limit possible negative economic effects. Were the authorities really trying to stem the desire to travel?
