#### Maps facilitated an ideal of commoner centered city
Maps like Ishikawa Ryulsen's perhaps had a particular appeal to a commoner audience because they allowed commoners access to the city both spatially and culturally, and thus facilitated the construction of an ideal, if not the reality, of a commoner-centered city. Like the advent of vernacular languages in the strictly linguistic sense, **printed maps allowed for new forms of expression and constituted new channels of agency for the common people who used them.** YONEMOTO

##### Shogunate did not monopolize map making
neither the shogunate, its officials, nor intellectuals monopolized the control of map images or spatial information. The shogunate depended upon the cooperation of daimyo and local officials to map Japan, and its struggles to enforce compliance with its orders reveal both the strengths and the limitations of the regime’s “parcellized sovereignty.” (3)

Printed maps and comic fiction on geographical themes provided an alternative and sometimes critical perspective on the substance and structure of the very political and cultural norms that, in their official guises, maps helped construct (4)
