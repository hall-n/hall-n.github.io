#### Communities and establishments relied on pilgrims for income
- Ferrymen at crossing points along the Tama and Sagami rivers came to rely on pilgrims for income. Villagers set up small inns providing meals and lodging for weary travelers, especially during the summer festival at Ōyama.
- These inns were established solely to accommodate pilgrims during the summer festival because there was no other substantial traffic through the villages. Many of these establishments were seasonal, operating only during the summer festival and providing temporary by-work for peasants hired from nearby villages. 
- By the latter half of the eighteenth century, towns in Sagami and Musashi had come to rely financially on the pilgrimage traffic to Ōyama.
- Evidence found in other sources, such as records of disputes and accidents involving station towns and river crossings, also suggests that the regional economy relied on pilgrimage travel to Ōyama.(150)

#### Adverse affects that minimized pilgrim travel were halted
The situation was no different along other routes apart from the Tōkaidō as pilgrims tried to minimize expenses along the way to Ōyama. By 1840, local communities along the major routes from Kai and Musashi had come to charge Ōyama pilgrims tolls to finance the repairs of roads and bridges, and overcharged them for ferry services, horses, palanquins, meals, and lodging. Consequently, pilgrims avoided these routes. This prompted local village heads and representatives of innkeepers from eleven villages in Tama District in Musashi and Aikō and Ōsumi Districts in Sagami to issue an agreement to cease collecting tolls for roads, cut the fees for ferries and bridges in half, and keep prices for horses, carriages, meals, and lodging within reasonable limits.

#### Commerce from pilgrimage became an essential part of the community
The pilgrimage to Ōyama also began to have a tangible impact on the regional communications system—both for overland and sea routes. The strongest impact of the pilgrimage was witnessed during the summer festival of Sekison between 6/28 and 7/17, when even villagers who normally did not cater to travelers operated inns, ferries, and other services along the roads to Ōyama. Even though the local transportation system was not created for and did not serve exclusively the pilgrimage to Ōyama, the **pilgrimage contributed greatly to the expansion of the existing system**, which, by the late eighteenth century, became almost synonymous with Ōyamamichi in the Kantō region. (159-160)

#### Pilgrimage did not have a negative economic effect on their home regions
Most pilgrimages to Ōyama took place during a distinct season before the harvest and involved only a few members of the community, allowing the rest to maintain their daily routine as usual so that village or neighborhood life was hardly disrupted. Moreover, the pilgrimages were primarily undertaken for the good of the entire community rather than for personal reasons. Upon their return, pilgrims brought everyone amulets for protection from harm and (160) illness. Therefore, pilgrims were not perceived as escapees from their home communities but rather as emissaries traveling on the community’s behalf. **Usually, neither the local communities nor bakufu authorities sought to prevent such journeys,** unless pilgrims either were behaving in wasteful ways or extended their journeys to too many sacred sites. (161)

#### Because pilgrims largely came from fraternities or parishes, they were not nukemairi
The regional make-up of the pilgrims reflects the overall distribution of Hachidayū’s parishes, which were concentrated in southeastern Musashi, Edo, and Shimōsa; therefore, the highest number of visitors (about 85 percent) came from these regions. (1)

## Petition system of Tosa to draw pilgrims
*Roberts 1998, Mercantilism in a Japanese Domain_ The Merchant Origins of Economic Nationalism in 18th-Century Tosa.*
Another case is especially interesting because it reveals a public space of political discussion that could be communicated to the lord by the accumulation of a number of individual petitions. (129
##### Petition to draw pilgrims
The scabbard maker Zenpachi's petition gives another example of how this thought was not merely a means of arguing self-interest, but was a convincing. (141) way of understanding the economy and the lord's and people's roles within it.15 Not one of Zenpachi's ten suggestions had personal economic interest at stake, yet most were inspired in whole or in part by bullionist concerns and phrased in terms of kokueki. (142)

Zenpachi also urged the lord to promote religious tourism to Tosa's famous Godaisan temple by making entry into the country easy for foreigners at the temple's festival time. If this were done and the pilgrims increased, "every year great amounts of foreign gold and silver would drop into the country, working eternally for the prosperity of the country and providing all of the people with a living." (142)

##### People seeing the overall benefit to the region 
What was common to these and many other petitions was a vision of Tosa as a single economic unit, the welfare of which was dependent mainly upon commercial concerns - most often export industries - and cash flow within the domain. (142)
##### People engaged in commerce saw the economic side of things
These documents reveal that merchants, by whom I mean not only townsmen (chonin) but also port merchants and other people significantly engaged in commerce, had already explored a wide range of ideas through the rhetoric of kokueki thought. The term kokueki appears commonly in the petitions of townsmen, even in the earliest petitions of the year 1759, playing a key role in an extensively developed rhetoric imagining a commercial economy for the domainal country of Tosa within a Japan of many countries. **Using the rhetoric of kokueki, they argue variously for** import protections, development of exports and import substitutes, the creation of a transportation and marketing infrastructure outside of the domain, **the ecouragement of tourism**, and even free trade economics, in short all of the basic elements of kokueki thought as defined by Fujita, and then some.

#### Villagers make changes to ensure pilgrims continue to use their routes
The situation was no different along other routes apart from the Tōkaidō as pilgrims tried to minimize expenses along the way to Ōyama. By 1840, local communities along the major routes from Kai and Musashi had come to charge Ōyama pilgrims tolls to finance the repairs of roads and bridges, and overcharged them for ferry services, horses, palanquins, meals, and lodging. Consequently, pilgrims avoided these routes.
