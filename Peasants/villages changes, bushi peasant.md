The policy of separating warriors and peasants was designed to
ensure better control over the bushi while still providing a means of governing the peasantry. When the daimyo's vassal retainers lived in villages as minor proprietors, they were self-reliant and often disregarded the higher authority of their daimyo masters, who feared acts of betrayal and perfidy. These rural bushi were also sensitive to the pressures from the peasantry, and, although most bushi had relatives and tenants in the villages, they were clearly in the rural minority. Consequently,
in kuni ikki and Ikko ikki, village-based retainers frequently allied with the peasants. The Honganji sect often served as the nucleus for this kind of confederation. To cite a concrete example, when a large-scale tsuchi ikki occurred in 1465, the shogunate, fearing that its own direct retainers might go over to the side of the farmers, compelled the protesters to assemble in the capital.35 By doing this, the shogunate strengthened its own position and prevented the rural federation of its rivals. Confronted with these circumstances, the policy of separating peasant from warrior took on a special meaning and can be seen as one step toward severing the connection between bushi and peasant power. 122
