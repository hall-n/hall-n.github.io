#### Travel was stimulated by the great amounts of published information.
The details of travel on the major roads were well-known through word of mouth, temple schoolhouse textbooks, and the vast body of travel literature that developed from early in the Edo period, as well as through the medium of wood-block prints, which reached new heights of popularity in the nineteenth century. Added to this were the parlor games called dochu sugoroku Gourney sugoroku), which were a popular pastime for both children and adults; the game boards were made of paper, came in different sizes, and although the Tokaido was the most popular, other roads were common as well. Even when feasting, one might find himself staring at representations of the Tokaido on sake cups or on food platters. Through a variety of mediums it was possible to "travel the fiftythree stages of the Edo Road [i.e., the Tokaido] without leaving your home."61 ( Vaporis 1994, 233)
