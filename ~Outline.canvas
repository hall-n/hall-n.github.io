They can explore and connect academic theories/research to develop an argument. Stella Cottrell offers some good guidance on how to structure your theme chapters. Each chapter should have the following elements (Cottrell, 2014, p183):\n#### Theme \nWhat is the theme of this chapter? Sequence your themes logically (e.g. from general to specific).  \n#### Argument\nWhat argument does this chapter present?  \n#### Material\nWhat material you will be using for this chapter? \n#### Clustering\nWhat are the main points you want to make? Deal with one point at a time, and don't jump around? Dedicate your points to sub-headings and paragraphs.  \n#### Sequence\nIn what order are you going to present the points you want to make in this chapter? Draw an outline of the chapter before starting writing it.  \n#### Introduction and Conclusion\nEach chapter should have a short introduction and conclusion. \n\n","x":-180,"y":80,"width":900,"height":720,"color":"6"},
		{"id":"d428cd75d8b476d0","type":"text","text":"## Conclusion\nThe conclusion is the final chapter of your dissertation. It should flow logically from the previously presented text; therefore, you should avoid introducing new ideas, new data, or a new direction.  \n\nIdeally, the conclusion should leave the reader with a clear understanding of the discovery or argument you have advanced.  \n\nThis can be done by: \n- Summarising and synthesising your main findings and how they relate to your research question or hypotheses  \n- Demonstrating the relevance and importance of your work in the wider context of your field. For example, what recommendations would you make for future research? What do we know now that we didn’t know before? \n\nTips \n- Link your conclusion to your introduction as both frame your dissertation. \n- A conclusion is roughly five to ten percent of the word count of the dissertation. \n- Avoid excessive detail. Decide what your reader needs to know. \n- Don’t introduce any new information such as theories, data or ideas.  \n- Sum up the main points of your research.  ","x":-180,"y":800,"width":900,"height":397,"color":"5"},
		{"id":"cf94e9eb9ad0b071","type":"text","text":"\n## Bibliography\nWhile writing your dissertation, you would have referred to the works and research of many different authors and editors in your field of study. These works should be acknowledged in the bibliography where you will list writers alphabetically by surname. \n\nFor example: \n\nPoloian, L.R. (2013). _Retailing principles: global, multichannel, and managerial viewpoints._ New York: Fairchild.   \nBiggs, J. and Tang, C. (2011). _Teaching for quality learning at university_. Maidenhead: Open University Press.   \nRamsay, P., Maier, P. and Price, G. (2010). _Study skills for business and management students_. Harlow: Longman. \n\nUnless otherwise specified by your module leader, the University uses the Harvard (author-date) style of citing and referencing. For more guidance and support on how to reference effectively check out the [Referencing Guide](https://libguides.westminster.ac.uk/referencing/examples). You can also [book an appointment](http://engage.westminster.ac.uk/s/library-and-academic-skills) with an Academic Engagement Librarian for extra help with referencing. \n\n## Appendices\nWhile the main results of your study should be placed in the body of your dissertation, any extra information can be placed in the appendices chapter. This supplementary information, for instance, can consist of graphs, charts, or tables that demonstrate less significant results or interview transcripts that would disrupt the flow of the main text if they were included within it.  \n\nYou can create one long appendix section or divide it into smaller sections to make it easier to navigate. For example, you might want to have an appendix for images, an appendix for transcripts, and an appendix for graphs. Each appendix (each graph or chart, etc.) should have its own number and title. Further, the sources for all appendices should be acknowledged through referencing and listed in the bibliography. \n\nDon’t forget to mention each appendix at least once during your dissertation! This can be done using brackets in the following way: (see appendix 1).","x":-180,"y":1197,"width":900,"height":523,"color":"2"},

Check with your supervisor if you are unsure.* \n\nThe term “literature” in “literature review” comprises scholarly articles, books, and other sources (e.g. reports) relevant to a particular issue, area of research or theory. In a dissertation, the literature review illustrates what the literature already says on your research subject, providing summary and synthesis of such literature.  \n\nIt is generally structured by topic, starting from general background and concepts, and then addressing what can be found - and cannot be found - on the specific focus of your dissertation. Indeed, the literature review should identify gaps in the literature, that your research aims to fill. This requires you to engage critically with the literature, not merely reproduce the critical understanding of others.  \n\nIn sum, literature reviews should demonstrate how your research question can be located in a wider field of inquiry. Therefore, a literature review needs to address the connections between your work and the work of others by highlighting links between them. In doing so, you will demonstrate the foundations of your project and show how you are taking the line of inquiry forwards.  \n\nBy the end of your literature review, your reader should be able to see: \n- The gap in knowledge and understanding which you say exists in the field. \n- How your research question will work within that gap. \n- The work other researchers have carried out and the issues debated in the field. \n- That you have a good understanding of the field and that you are critically engaged with the debates (Burnett, 2009). \n\nFor more detailed guidance on how to write literature reviews, check out the Literature Review Guide. \n","x":-830,"y":-458,"width":650,"height":463,"color":"5"}
