	"despite many restrictions on what people in each status group were allowed to do, the Tokugawa did not micromanage the lives of ordinary people. Within the confines of a circumscribed world, commoners had considerable autonomy. It is true they needed permission to travel and were not supposed to move to cities. But enforcement of such rules was often quite lax. In practice, the bakufu and domain governments kept out of the internal affairs of villages, as long as the villagers paid their taxes." 16

	Both these cities, and the roads between them, teemed with life….The country is populous beyond expression, and one would scarce think it possible, that being no greater than it is, it should nevertheless maintain and support such a vast number of inhabitants. The highways are in almost continuous rows of villages and boroughs: you scarce come out of one, but you enter another; and you may travel many miles, as it were, without knowing it to be composed of many villages. 21

	Travel became so common by the late eighteenth century that a lively publishing

	The roads moved things as well as people. To this end, a busy packhorse transport

	industry sprung up, leading thousands of teamsters to jostle for road space with travelers. Historians have analyzed the records of these shippers, which reveal the density of economic activity by the 1700s. 25


*Totman 2005*
	Inspectors periodically investigated the highways, and in general the roads appear to have been maintained in satisfactory condition, though mountain stretches commonly were treacherous and secondary roads inferior. 239

	Finally, governments too developed rules to cope with scarcity, most pervasively through sumptuary regulations. Originally the bakufu issued a few to give outward expression to shinokosho status distinctions by stipulating restrictions on residence style and scale, clothing, ornaments, and conduct. As scarcities became more pronounced late in the seventeenth century, however, sumptuary regulations multiplied like topsy. Legitimized by being embedded in the status order, they strove to regulate consumption of all manner of forest products, foodstuffs, metals, clothing, and myriad other items, thereby allocating scarce resources to status groups in proportions acceptable to the rulers. Even labor time became an object of attention as decrees sought to discourage recreation, inessential travel, and other "unproductive" uses of time. 265


*Vaporis 1995, The Early Modern Origins of Japanese Tourism*
	"Kaempfer [1906, 2: 330], for example, wrote bf the "great numbers of people, who daily travel on the roads" and said that it was "owing partly to the Country's being extremely populous, partly to the frequent journies, which the natives undertake, oftener than perhaps any other nation, either willingly and out of their free choice, or because they are necessitated to it" 25
	"Kaempfer [1906, 2: 35] noted early on that the Japanese were "very much addicted to Pilgrimage." 25
	"urbanization and the redistribution of labor through migration" 25 were also reasons for travel/movement

What is Tourism?
	"Cohen defines a tourist as "a voluntary, temporary traveler, traveling in the expectation of pleasure from the novelty and change experienced on a relatively long and non-recurrent round-trip.""31

Against  tourism
	"Government did not recognize the concept of tourism, and therefore discouraged all recreational or touristic travel. In Kaga (1708), for example, residents in rural areas were told that: "Sightseeing or the making of pilgrimages to temples in Kanazawa is of no worth (may6). The same is all the more true for long-distance travel."3) But because domains were more tolerant of pilgrimage to Ise, for many the trip there, whether officially sanctioned or not, became an excuse to travel" 32-33
	"In the face of widespread flouting of the permit process and violations on bans on pilgrimage, domains seemed at a loss as to what to do." 33
	Often don't actually go to Ise or only visit outer shrine

Similar to modern tourism
	"While quite characteristic of modern tourism, it appears that Tokugawa tourists just as well could be more concerned or involved with "on-site markers"--for example, placards, plans, appropriate souvenirs--than the site,s themselves, "as though they were checking off a list of having truly visited the approved sights by the mere recognition of their markers" [GRABuRN 1983: 46] ." 34
	"Yamamoto Mitsumasa's study of travel diaries shows that pilgrims tended to .follow set itineraries when sightseeing in Edo," 34
	"For Kita and Yaji of Hizakurige. as well as the large number of named and anonymous travel diarists, it was as much the pleasures of the trip, the local delicacies, the entertainments, even the women, that made the trip worthwhile." 24
	"For some stations (like Akasaka or Mishima), the prostitutes appear to have been the main attraction that drew travelers. As a bakiofu oMcial, Tanaka Kyagu, declared, "Those stations with them [i.e., prostitutes] prosper, those without them fall into economic decline."" 35
	"Post stations and urban centers all had specialty products (meibutsu)-natural and cultural products as well as religious talismans-that provided nourishment to travelers or served as souvenirs and gifts." 35
